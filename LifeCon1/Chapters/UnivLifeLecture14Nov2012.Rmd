## Introduction to Universal Life

A **Universal Life** (UL) contract combines life insurance with an
investment product in a transparent, flexible format. The policyholder
may vary the amount and timing of premiums, within some constraints.
Here is how it works:

-   The **premium** is deposited into an account, which is used to
    determine the death and survival benefits.

-   The insurer credits **interest** to the account at regular intervals
    (typically monthly).

-   The account, made up of the premiums and credited interest, is
    subject to deductions for management **expenses** and for the **cost
    of life insurance** coverage.

-   The account balance or **account value** (AV) is the balance of
    funds in the account.

The account value represents the insurer’s liability, analogous to the
reserve under a traditional contract.

-   Universal Life (UL) policies are sold as “permanent” life contracts
    (with tax advantages)

-   The AV represents the underlying value of the contract, and is used
    to determined the cash value

With the UL, the policyholder’s money is not associated with specific
assets, they are held in “notional” accounts. Credited interest declared
need not reflect actual earnings

In contrast, the **Variable Universal Life** (VUL), monies are held in
separate accounts. Interest credited is directly associated with the
yields on these funds. This is studied in Chapter 12 of DHW (but not by
us).

**Origins of Universal Life**

Universal Life (UL) account values are based on an accumulation
(recursive) process - known for well over 100 years. The idea behind UL
apparently came up in the 1960’s, was made public in the 1970’s, and
took off as a product in the 1980’s. Here are some references from Black
and Skipper on *Life Insurance*,

-   George R. Dinney, “Universal Life,” *The Actuary*, Vol. XV,
    supplement (September 1981). p. 1;

-   Timothy Lynch, ”Universal Life Insurance: A Primer,” *The Journal of
    the American Society of Chartered Life Underwriters*, Vol. XXXVI
    (July 1982)

According to Black and Skipper, the UL concept was at first not welcomed
by most persons in the North American life insurance business. It was
perceived as a threat to the orderly development of the industry, and as
not being in consumers’ or agents’ best interests.

Universal life policy sales in the United States had a meteoric rise
from an effective zero market share of new sales in 1979 to over 38
percent in 1985, its peak year. Since then, its share has declined to
around a quarter of new individual life premiums-still a major
proportion.

## Design Features of a UL Policy

We now review in more detail the key design features of a UL policy.

-   **Death Benefit:** On the policyholder’s death the total benefit
    paid is the account value of the policy, plus an **additional death
    benefit** (ADB).

    There are two types of death benefit:

    -   **Type A** offers a *level* total death benefit $\equiv$ the
        **Face Amount** of the policy. Here, Face Amount = AV + ADB. As
        the account value (AV) increases, the ADB decreases.

    -   **Type B** offers a *level ADB*. The amount paid on death would
        be the AV plus the level ADB selected by the policyholder. The
        policyholder may have the option to adjust the ADB to allow for
        inflation.

-   Corridor factor = $\frac{\text{AV + ADB}}{\text{AV}}$.

-   The ADB is required to be significant, e.g., around 2.5 at age 40,
    decreasing to 1.05 at age 90.

![image](Figures\UL_VaryingBenefitAmounts.pdf){width="120.00000%"}

-   **Premiums:** These may be subject to some minimum level, but
    otherwise are highly flexible.

-   **Expense Charges:** These are deducted from the account value. The
    rates will be variable at the insurer’s discretion, subject to a
    maximum specified in the original contract.

-   **Credited Interest:** Usually the credited interest rate will be
    decided at the insurer’s discretion, but it may be based on a
    published exogenous rate, such as yields on government bonds. A
    minimum guaranteed annual credited interest rate will be specified
    in the policy document.

<!-- -->

-   **Cost of Insurance:** Each year the UL account value is subject to
    a charge to cover the cost of the selected death benefit cover.

    -   The charge is called the Cost of Insurance, or CoI.

    -   Usually, the CoI is calculated using an estimate (perhaps
        conservative) of the mortality rate for that period, so that, as
        the policyholder ages, the mortality charge (per \$1 of ADB)
        increases.

    -   The CoI is then the single premium for a 1-year term insurance
        with sum insured equal to the ADB.

-   **Surrender Charge:** If the policyholder chooses to surrender the
    policy early, the surrender value paid will be the policyholder’s
    account balance reduced by a surrender charge.

    -   The main purpose of the charge is to ensure that the insurer
        receives enough to pay its acquisition expenses.

    -   The total cash available to the policyholder on surrender is the
        account value minus the surrender charge (or zero if greater),
        and is referred to as the **Cash Value** of the contract at each
        duration.

<!-- -->

-   **Secondary Guarantees:** A common feature is a no lapse guarantee

    -   Coverage continues even if the account value declines to zero,
        provided that the policyholder pays a pre-specified minimum
        premium

    -   This guarantee comes into play if expense and mortality charges
        exceed the minimum premium

-   **Policy Loans:** Option: policyholder takes out a loan using the
    cash value as collateral.

**Example: DHW SN 4.1: Type B UL Account Values**

-   A universal life policy is sold to a 45 year old man. The initial
    premium is \$2250 and the ADB is a fixed \$100,000. The policy
    charges are: $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Cost of Insurance:}&&\text{120\% of the mortality of the Standard Select Mortality Model.}\\
    &&\text{5\% per year interest.}\\
    \text{Expense Charges:}&&\text{\$48 + 1\% of premium at the start of
    each year.}\end{aligned}$$

-   Surrender penalties at each year end are the lesser of the full
    account value and the following surrender penalty schedule:

  ------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ -------
  Year of surrender        1      2    3-4    5-7   8-10   $>$10
  Penalty               4500   4100   3500   2500   1200       0
  ------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ -------

-   Assume (i) the policy remains in force for 20-years, (ii) interest
    is credited to the account at 5% per year, (iii) the policyholder
    pays the full premium of \$2250 each year, (iv) all cash flows occur
    at policy anniversaries.

-   Project the account value and the cash value at each year end for
    the 20-year projected term.

<!-- -->

-   Each year, the insurer deducts from the account value the expense
    charge and the cost of insurance (which is the price for a 1-year
    term insurance with sum insured equal to the ADB), and adds to the
    account value any new premiums paid, and the credited interest for
    the year.

-   The first year is:

      ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
      Premium             2250
      Expense Charge      $48 + 0.01\times 2250 = 70.50$
      CoI                 $100,000\times 1.2 \times 0.0006592\times v = 75.34$
      Interest Credited   $0.05\times (2250-70.50-75.34) = 105.21$
      Account Value       $2250-70.50-75.34+105.21=2209.37$
      Cash Value          max$(2209.37-4500,0) = 0$
      ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------

-   The second year is:\

  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  Premium             2250
  Expense Charge      $48 + 0.01\times 2250 = 70.50$
  CoI                 $100,000\times 1.2 \times 0.0007973\times v = 91.13$
  Interest Credited   $0.05\times (2209.37+2250-70.50-91.13) = 214.89$
  Account Value       $2209.37+2250-70.50-91.13+214.89=4512.63$
  Cash Value          max$(4512.63-4100,0) = 412.63$

## Recursive Formulas for Universal Life

### Review of Asset Shares and Emerging Profits

Recall our recursive asset share formula $$\begin{aligned}
(~_k AS + G_k - e_k)(1+i_k)  &= &
q_{[x]+k}^{(d)} \left(b_{k+1} + E_{k+1}\right) \\
&~~~~+& q_{[x]+k}^{(w)} ~_{k+1} CV  + p_{[x]+k}^{(\tau)} ~_{k+1} AS\end{aligned}$$

Asset shares are calculated during the year (using experience or another
basis). Then, the profit during the year (at time $k+1$) is
$$\begin{aligned}
Pr_{k+1}  &= & \left( _k AS + G_k -e_k\right) (1+ i_k) -
q_{[x]+k}^{(d)} \left(b_{k+1} + E_{k+1}\right) \\
&~~~~-& q_{[x]+k}^{(w)} ~_{k+1} CV  - p_{[x]+k}^{(\tau)} ~_{k+1} AS
.\end{aligned}$$

Define $\Pi_{k+1} = ~_k p_{[x]}^{(\tau)} Pr_{k+1}$ to be profits
discounted for survivorship.

To summarize profits, we might use the net present value
$$\begin{aligned}
NPV = \sum_k \left(\frac{1}{1+r} \right)^k \Pi_k\end{aligned}$$ or
another summary measure.

### Universal Life with Type B Death Benefit

We can now apply these same basic principles to account value formulas.

Use $AV$ for account value instead of AS, use $FA$ for face amount
instead of benefit, and ignore lapsation. From the asset share formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
(~_k AV + G_k - e_k)(1+i_k^c)  &= &
q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} + E_{k+1}\right) +  p_{[x]+k} ~_{k+1} AV \\
&= q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} + E_{k+1} - ~_{k+1} AV \right) +~_{k+1}
AV\end{aligned}$$

With only one decrement (death), we have dropped the cause notation.
Further, use $i_k^c$ for the interest credited. Now, we will define the
Cost of Insurance to be $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}  =v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} + E_{k+1} - ~_{k+1} AV
\right)\end{aligned}$$ where $v_q$ is a discount factor. In the prior
example, we used 5% for both the interest credited and the CoI discount
factor.

With discount factor $v_q$, the Cost of Insurance is $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}  =v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} + E_{k+1} - ~_{k+1} AV
\right) .\end{aligned}$$ With this, we define the account value
$$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+1} AV  = (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$

For Type B UL, the additional death benefit is $$\begin{aligned}
 ADB_{k+1} = FA_{k+1}  - ~_{k+1} AV = \text{constant}\end{aligned}$$ so
the recursion as presented is easy to calculate. Not so for Type A. We
can use account values (with a possibly different interest rate) to
determine the profit during the year (at time $k+1$) $$\begin{aligned}
Pr_{k+1}  &= & \left( _k AV + G_k -e_k\right) (1+ i_k) -
q_{[x]+k}^{(d)} \left(FA_{k+1} + E_{k+1}\right) \\
&~~~~-& q_{[x]+k}^{(w)} ~_{k+1} CV  - p_{[x]+k}^{(\tau)} ~_{k+1} AV
.\end{aligned}$$

**Example: DHW SN 4.2: Type B UL Profit Test**

-   A universal life policy is sold to a 45 year old man, policy in
    force for 20 years. Premium is \$2250 for six years and the ADB is a
    fixed \$100,000.

-   100% of the mortality of the Standard Select Mortality Model,

-   interest on all funds is 7 %, interest credited is 5%

-   Incurred expenses are \$2000 at inception, \$45 plus 1% of premium
    at renewal, \$50 on surrender (even if no cash value is paid), \$100
    on death.

-   Surrender (withdrawal) rates are:\

      ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------- ------
      Year        1    2-5   6-10     11   12-19     20
      Rate     0.05   0.02   0.03   0.10    0.15   1.00
      ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------- ------

-   Project the profits at each year end for the 20 years.

-   The expense at policy initiation is 2,000, so $Pr_0 =-2000$.

## Type A Universal Life

We now modify our definition of the Cost of Insurance to accommodate
Type A policies and the “corridor factor.” To simplify matters, drop
settlement expenses and define the unmodified version to be
$$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^f  =v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} - ~_{k+1} AV ^f \right)\end{aligned}$$
and the associated account value $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+1} AV^f  = (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k ^f )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$
Recall that we can think of the corridor factor as
$\frac{\text{AV + ADB}}{\text{AV}}=\frac{\text{ADB}}{\text{AV}}+1$. So,
now suppose that the corridor factor $\gamma_{k+1}$ is (exogenously)
given. Define a modified cost of insurance $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^c  &=v_q q_{[x]+k} (\gamma_{k+1} -1)  \times ~_{k+1} AV ^c\end{aligned}$$
and the associated account value $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+1} AV^c  = (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k ^c )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$

The account value is thus $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+1} AV  = \min \left(~_{k+1} AV^f ,  ~_{k+1} AV ^c \right) .\end{aligned}$$
With $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+1} AV^f  &= (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k ^f )(1+i_k^c)\\
~_{k+1} AV^c  &= (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k ^c )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$
we can write this recursively as $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+1} AV  = (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k )(1+i_k^c) ,\end{aligned}$$
where $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_k = \max \left(CoI_k ^f ,  CoI_k  ^c \right)\end{aligned}$$

To use the recursive formula for the account value, we need to calculate
the cost of insurance. To this end, we start with $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^f  &=v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} - ~_{k+1} AV ^f \right) \\
~_{k+1} AV^f  &= (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k ^f )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$
We can write $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^f  = v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} - (~_k AV + G_k - e_k
-CoI_k ^f )(1+i_k^c) \right)\end{aligned}$$ so $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^f (1-v_q q_{[x]+k}(1+i_k^c)) = v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1}
- (~_k AV + G_k - e_k  )(1+i_k^c) \right)\end{aligned}$$ which yields
$$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^f &=\frac{v_q q_{[x]+k} \left(FA_{k+1} - (~_k AV + G_k -
e_k  )(1+i_k^c) \right)}{1-v_q q_{[x]+k}(1+i_k^c)}\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, using $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^c  &= v_q q_{[x]+k} (\gamma_{k+1} -1)  \times ~_{k+1} AV ^c \\
~_{k+1} AV^c  &= (~_k AV + G_k - e_k -CoI_k ^c )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$
We can write $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^c  &= v_q q_{[x]+k} (\gamma_{k+1} -1) (~_k AV + G_k - e_k
-CoI_k ^c )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$ so $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^c (1+v_q q_{[x]+k} (\gamma_{k+1} -1)(1+i_k^c)) = v_q
q_{[x]+k} (\gamma_{k+1} -1) (~_k AV + G_k - e_k  )(1+i_k^c)\end{aligned}$$
which yields $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_{k}^c &=\frac{v_q q_{[x]+k} (\gamma_{k+1} -1) (~_k AV + G_k -
e_k  )(1+i_k^c)}{1+v_q q_{[x]+k}(\gamma_{k+1} -1)(1+i_k^c)}\end{aligned}$$

We wish to:

-   \(a) Project the account and cash values for this policy.

-   \(b) Profit test the contract using the basis below. Use annual steps,
    and determine the NPV and DPP using a risk discount rate of 10% per
    year.

*Solution:* I will only go through the details for part (a). The study
note provides information about the solution to part (b).

To begin, we first note that the CoI discount rate equals the credited
interest. This means $$\begin{aligned}
 v_q (1+i_k^c)=1\end{aligned}$$ which simplifies our calculations.

For the First Year ($k=0$), we have

  Premium          3500
  Expense Charge   200 + (0.20) 3500 = 900

CoI_0^f &=\frac{q_{[45]} \left(v_q FA_1 - (~_0 AV + G_0 - e_0  ) \right)}{1-q_{[45]}} \\
&= \frac{(1.2) q_{[45]} (v_{.04}100 000  - (3500-900))} {1 - (1.2)
q_{[45]}} = 74.07\end{aligned}$$ CoI assuming the death benefit is based
on the corridor factor $$\begin{aligned}
CoI_0^c &=\frac{q_{[45]} (\gamma_1 -1) (~_0 AV + G_0 - e_0  )}{1+(1.2 q_{[45]})(\gamma_1 -1)} \\
&= \frac{1.2(0.0006592) (2.15 -1) (3500-900 )}{1+
1.2(0.0006592)(2.15 -1)}=2.36\end{aligned}$$

  --------------- ----------------------------------------
  $CoI_0$         $\max(CoI_0^f, CoI_0^c) = 74.07$
  Account Value   (3500 - 900 - 74.07) (1.04) = 2 626.97
  Cash Value      max(2626.97 - 2500, 0) = 126.97
