# Policy Values
## Special Case: Whole Life Insurance Policy {#S:WLifeFoundations}

We can illustrate many important concepts in terms of this basic policy.
For concreteness, we assume the fully continuous case, that pays 1
immediately upon the failure of the policyholder and where level
premiums are payable continuously throughout the year until the moment
of failure.

As before, we assume that contract initiation age is $x$. We now wish to
establish the value of the policy $t$ years later when the policyholder
is age $x+t$ (if alive).

![image](Figures\PV_FWholeLifeTimeLine.eps){width=".8\textwidth"}

At (policy) time $t$, we define the *future (net) loss variable* (to the
insurer) to be the excess of the present value of future insurance
benefits (PVFB) over the present value of future net premiums (PVFNP)
$$\begin{aligned}
L_t^n = PVFB - PVFNP = v^{T-t} - P^n \bar{a}_{\overline{T-t}|}.\end{aligned}$$
Because $T$ is random, $L_t^n$ is a random variable; although we focus
on its mean, the variance and distribution function are also important
for different applications.

To get a step closer to reality, we can easily add expenses into the
mix. As before, we think of a “gross premium,” $G$ or $P^G$, as an
income that accounts for benefits and expenses. With this, define the
*future gross loss variable* to be $$\begin{aligned}
L_t^g = PVFB + PVFE - PVFGP,\end{aligned}$$ where PFVE represents the
present value of future expenses and PVFGP represents the present value
of future gross premiums.

The *policy value*, also known as the reserve, is the expected future
loss variable, typically denoted as $V = \mathrm{E~} L$. Sometimes we
write $_t V = \mathrm{E~} (L_t | T>t)$ to emphasize the conditional
expectation, that is, we are only computing policy values for
individuals who have survived $t$ future years. In this basic case, the
constant premium rate $P$ is determined at contract initiation, e.g., at
$t=0$.

**Policy Value.** Specifically, at time $t$, the EPV of future benefits
is $\mathrm{E~} (v^{T-t}|T>t )= \bar{A}_{x+t}$. The EPV of future
premiums is
$\mathrm{E~} (P^n \bar{a}_{\overline{T-t}|}|T>t )= P^n \bar{a}_{x+t}$.
With these, the net premium policy value is $$\begin{aligned}
~_t V^n = \bar{A}_{x+t} - P^n \bar{a}_{x+t}.\end{aligned}$$ In the
premium module, we learned that we could derive net premiums through the
equivalence principle, that is, find $P^n$ such that
$\mathrm{E~} L_0^n = ~_0 V^n = 0$. Thus, we have
$P^n = \bar{A}_x/\bar{a}_x.$

**Variance.** With the net premium and the relation
$\bar{a}_{\overline{T-t}|}=(1-v^{T-t})/\delta$, we write the net premium
loss variable as $$\begin{aligned}
L_t^n =v^{T-t} - P^n \frac{1-v^{T-t}}{\delta}= \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right) - \frac{P}{\delta}.\end{aligned}$$
Thus, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{Var}(L_t^n|T>t) &= \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right)^2 \textrm{Var}(v^{T-t}|T>t) \\
&= \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right)^2 \left( ~^2 \bar{A}_{x+t} - \bar{A}_{x+t}^2 \right) .\end{aligned}$$
Here, recall the notation $~^2 \bar{A}$ means compute the EPV of a whole
life insurance at force of interest $2\delta$.

**Example.** Suppose that mortality follows De Moivre’s law with
limiting age $w=100$. Let $i=6\%$ and $x=35$. Then, $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{35} = \int_0^{65} v^t ~_t p_{35} \mu_{35+t}~ dt = \frac{1}{65} \int_0^{65} v^t  dt = \frac{1}{65} \bar{a}_{\overline{65}|}\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
P^n = \frac{\bar{A}_{35}}{\bar{a}_{35}} =\frac{\delta \bar{A}_{35}}{1-\bar{A}_{35}} =
\frac{\delta \bar{a}_{\overline{65}|} /65}{1-\bar{a}_{\overline{65}|} /65} = 0.020266.\end{aligned}$$
Similarly, we have $\bar{A}_{35+t}=\bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}/(65-t)$
and $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{35+t}= \frac{1-\bar{A}_{35+t}}{\delta} =\frac{1-\bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}/(65-t)}{\delta}\end{aligned}$$
The policy value may be written as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t V^n  = \frac{\bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}}{65-t} - (0.020266)\frac{65-t-\bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}}{\delta(65-t)}.\end{aligned}$$
and its associated variability is $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{Var}(L_t^n|T>t)&= \left(1+\frac{0.020266}{\delta}\right)^2 \left( \frac{~^2 \bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}}{65-t} - \left[\frac{\bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}}{65-t}\right]^2 \right) \\
&=
1.813821 \left( \frac{~^2 \bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}}{65-t} - \left[\frac{\bar{a}_{\overline{65-t}|}}{65-t}\right]^2 \right)\end{aligned}$$
using $\delta = \ln(1.06)$. Figure 1 summarizes these calculations. Note
that the policy value is 0 at $t=0$. At $t=65$, the policy value becomes
1. Also at $t=65$, there is no uncertainty about the value of the policy
and so the standard deviation becomes 0.

**Simulation**. With Monte Carlo, or stochastic, simulation, we can
easily get additional insights. To illustrate ideas, we focus on the
loss random variable at $t=10$.

We let $U$ be a randomly generated uniform random number on $(0,1)$. In
this case, the future (given $T>10$) remaining lifetime random variable
$T -10 = 55*U$, that is, uniform on the interval $(0,55)$. For this
randomly generated future lifetime, the corresponding loss random
variable is $$\begin{aligned}
L_t^n = v^{T-10} - (0.020266) \bar{a}_{\overline{T-10}|}.\end{aligned}$$
We generated 100,000 replications of this loss random variable (taking
less than two seconds on a moderately slow notebook). Figure 2
summarizes the distribution of these replications. The average of this
distribution turned out to be 0.055512; this is very close to the
theoretically correct value determined above, 0.055701. The standard
deviation from the Figure 2 sample is 0.3459959, close to 0.3466074 that
was determined by theory. Figure 2 shows that the maximum value is 1.0
(corresponding to $T=10$) and the minimum value is -0.29310,
corresponding to $T=65$.

![image](Figures\PV_F2WholeLifeDistn.eps){width=".5\textwidth"}

The simulation gives a quick method to calculate the same values that we
could determine from theory. Simulation also allows us to readily see
the entire *distribution* of the loss random variable - for this simple
example, we could determine the distribution from theory. Moreover,
theoretical calculations allow us to readily visualize patterns over
evolving time duration $t$. As we will see, the advantage of simulation
methods is that they provide flexibility to easily modify design aspects
such as timing of benefits and payments, as well as for discounting
mechanisms such as variable interest rates. You will find it helpful to
become facile in doing calculations using both theory and simulation
approaches.

**Try an animated display where the distribution changes by the policy
duration**

**Exercise**. Show that the probability density function for the loss
random variable is

$$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{f}_{L_t}(y) &= \frac{1}{(65-t)(y \delta + P^n)}.\end{aligned}$$

*Solution.*

The distribution function of $L_t^n$ is $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{F}_{L_t}(y) &= \Pr(L_t^n \leq y) =  \Pr(v^{T-t} - P
\left(\frac{1-v^{T-t}}{\delta}
\right) \leq y) \\
&= \Pr(v^{T-t} \leq \frac{y \delta +P}{\delta + P}) = \Pr(T-t \geq -\frac{1}{\delta} \ln \left(\frac{y \delta +P}{\delta + P}\right) )\end{aligned}$$
Conditional on $T>t$, $T-t$ is uniform on $(0,65-t)$, so
$$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{F}_{L_t}(y) &= \frac{65-t -\frac{1}{\delta} \ln \left(\frac{y \delta +P}{\delta + P}\right) )}{65-t}\end{aligned}$$
Taking a partial derivative with respect to $y$ yields $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{f}_{L_t}(y) &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \frac{65-t -\frac{1}{\delta} \ln \left(\frac{y \delta +P}{\delta + P}\right) )}{65-t} \\
&= \frac{-1}{\delta (65-t)} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}  \ln (y \delta +P)  \\
&= \frac{1}{(65-t)(y \delta + P)},\end{aligned}$$ as required.

## Exercise: Fully Continuous *n* Year Endowment Policy

In this policy, a benefit of 1 is payable immediately upon failure.
Premiums are payable at a constant annual rate of $P$ per year that is
determined at contract initiation by the equivalence principle. Assume a
constant force of interest and no expenses. The policy valuation is at
time $t<n$.

1\. Express the (net) premium using standard actuarial notation.

2\. Express the loss random variable using standard interest theory
symbols.

3\. Express the policy value using standard actuarial notation.

4\. Express the standard deviation of the loss random variable using
standard actuarial notation.

5\. Suppose that $x=35$, $n=20$, $i=6\%$, $t=5$, and mortality follows
deMoivre’s law with limiting age $w=100$. Calculate the policy value and
standard deviation.

*Solution.*

1\. The net premium is $P =
\frac{\bar{A}_{x:\overline{n}|}}{\bar{a}_{x:\overline{n}|}}$.

2\. If $T<t$, then the policy is complete and we do not consider it
further. If $T \ge n$ (exceeding the endowment period), then the loss
random variable is $L_t = v^{n-t} - P
\bar{a}_{\overline{n-t}|}$, where $P$ is from part (1). If $t \leq
T<n$, then the loss random variable is $L_t = v^{T-t} - P
\bar{a}_{\overline{T-t}|}$. We summarize this as $$\begin{aligned}
L_t &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  v^{T-t} - P \bar{a}_{\overline{T-t}|} & t \leq T<n \\
  v^{n-t} - P \bar{a}_{\overline{n-t}|} & T \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$

3\. Recall that the “$n-t$” single premium endowment issued to a life age
$x+t$ has loss $$\begin{aligned}
L_t^{Insurance} &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  v^{T-t}  & T<n \\
  v^{n-t} & T \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$ and expectation
$\bar{A}_{x+t:\overline{n-t}|}$. Similarly, an “$n-t$” temporary life
annuity issued to a life age $x+t$ has loss $$\begin{aligned}
L_t^{Annuity} &=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  \bar{a}_{\overline{T-t}|}  & T<n \\
 \bar{a}_{\overline{n-t}|} & T \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$ and expectation
$\bar{a}_{x+t:\overline{n-t}|}$. Thus, the loss random variable is just
$L_t = L_t^{Insurance} -P L_t^{Annuity}$ with expectation (policy value)
$_t V =\bar{A}_{x+t:\overline{n-t}|}-P \bar{a}_{x+t:\overline{n-t}|}$.

4\. Using the relation $\bar{a}_{\overline{n}|} = (1-v^{n})/\delta$, we
have $$\begin{aligned}
L_t &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right) v^{T-t} - \frac{P}{\delta}  & t<T<n \\
  \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right) v^{n-t} - \frac{P}{\delta}  & T \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .
 = \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right) L_t^{Insurance} - \frac{P}{\delta} .\end{aligned}$$
From this, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{Var}(L_t|T>t) &= \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right)^2 \textrm{Var}(L_t^{Insurance}|T>t) \\
&= \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right)^2
 \left(~^2 \bar{A}_{x+t:\overline{n-t}|}- \bar{A}_{x+t:\overline{n-t}|}^2 \right)\end{aligned}$$

5\. We first compute the premium $$\begin{aligned}
P &= \frac{\bar{A}_{35:\overline{20}|}}{\bar{a}_{35:\overline{20}|}} = \frac{\delta \bar{A}_{35:\overline{20}|}}{1- \bar{A}_{35:\overline{20}|}}\end{aligned}$$
For our problem, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{35:\overline{20}|} &= \int_0^{20} v^t ~_t p_{35} \mu_{35+t} dt + v^{20} ~_{20} p_{35} \\
&= \frac{1}{65} \bar{a}_{\overline{20|}} + v^{20} \frac{45}{65} = 0.39756 .\end{aligned}$$
that yields $$\begin{aligned}
P &=\frac{\ln(1.06) (0.39756)}{1- 0.39756} =  0.03845.\end{aligned}$$
We can express the policy value as $$\begin{aligned}
_5 V =\bar{A}_{40:\overline{15}|}-P \bar{a}_{40:\overline{15}|}\end{aligned}$$
As before, $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{40:\overline{15}|} &= \frac{1}{60} \bar{a}_{\overline{15|}} + v^{15} \frac{45}{60} = 0.479628\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{40:\overline{15}|} &= \frac{1-\bar{A}_{\overline{40:15}|}}{\delta}= 8.930516 ,\end{aligned}$$
so $$\begin{aligned}
_5 V  =0.479628-(0.03845 )8.930516 = 0.11458.\end{aligned}$$ For the
variance, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{Var}(L_5|T>5)
&= \left(1+\frac{P}{\delta}\right)^2
 \left(~^2 \bar{A}_{\overline{40:15}|}- \bar{A}_{\overline{40:15}|}^2 \right) \\
&= \left(1+\frac{0.03845}{\ln(1.06)}\right)^2
 \left(0.24869- 0.479628^2 \right) =0.051378,
 \end{aligned}$$ using
$~^2 \bar{A}_{40:\overline{15}|}=\frac{1}{60} ~^2 \bar{a}_{\overline{15|}} + v^{2\times15} \frac{45}{60}=0.24869.$
Thus, the standard deviation is $\sqrt{0.051378}=0.22667$.

## Policy Values with Annual Cash Flows

To develop intuition, it is helpful to begin with a traditional
framework. Here, policies have premiums that are payable annually (at
the beginning of the year, by convention) and have benefits that are
payable at the end of the year of failure.

**Special Case: $n$-Year Term Insurance**. For this policy, level
premiums are payable at the beginning of each year up until failure, or
$n$ years if sooner. A death benefit of 1 is payable at the end of the
year of failure, if within $n$ years. When time point $t=h$ is an
integer, the loss variable is $$\begin{aligned}
L_h &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  v^{K+1-h} - P ~\ddot{a}_{\overline{K+1-h}|} & h \leq K<n \\
  0 - P ~\ddot{a}_{\overline{n-h}|} & K \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$ 
 
 This has expectation, or policy value, $~_h V =
A_{x+h:\overline{n-h|}}^{~~1} - P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}
~\ddot{a}_{x+h:\overline{n-h|}}$.

**See the animated display where the value changes by the interest
rate**

**Special Case: $m$-pay, $n$-Year Endowment Insurance**. For this
policy, level premiums are payable at the beginning of each year up
until failure, or $m$ years if sooner. A benefit of 1 is payable at the
end of the year of failure or $n$ years, whichever is sooner.

When the policy is in the premium payment period, time point $t=h <m$.
The loss variable is $$\begin{aligned}
L_h &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  v^{K+1-h} - P \ddot{a}_{\overline{K+1-h}|} & 0 \leq K<m \\
  v^{K+1-h} - P \ddot{a}_{\overline{m-h}|} & m \leq K<n \\
  v^{n-h} - P \ddot{a}_{\overline{m-h}|} & K \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$ This has expectation, or policy value,
$~_h V = A_{x+h:\overline{n-h|}} - P ~ \ddot{a}_{x+h:\overline{m-h|}}$.

When the policy is past the premium payment period, time point
$t=h \ge m$. In this case, the loss variable is $$\begin{aligned}
L_h &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  v^{K+1-h} & h \leq K<n \\
  v^{n-h} & K \ge n
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$ This has expectation, or policy value,
$~_h V = A_{x+h:\overline{n-h|}}$.

**General Discrete Policy.** For a general discrete policy, we have
(known) premiums $P_h$ payable at time $h$ and benefits payable at time
$b_h$. The loss variable is $$\begin{aligned}
L_h &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  0 & 0 \leq K < h \\
  b_{K+1} v^{K+1-h} - \sum_{j=h}^K P_j v^{j-h} & K \geq  h \\
\end{array}
 \right .\end{aligned}$$ Using a summation by parts, this has
expectation $$\begin{aligned}
~_h V &= \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}
\left(b_{h+j+1} v^{j+1} - \sum_{k=0}^y P_{h+k} v^k \right) ~_{j|} q_{x+h} \\
&= \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{h+j+1} v^{j+1} ~_{j|} q_{x+h}
- \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} P_{h+j} v^j  ~_j p_{x+h} \\
&= E (PVFB) - E(PVFP) .\end{aligned}$$

## Recursive Calculations: Policy Values with Annual Cash Flows {#S:Recursive}

Begin with the expression for the general discrete policy and split off
the first year $$\begin{aligned}
~_h V &=  b_{h+1} v  q_{x+h} - P_h+
 \sum_{s=0}^{\infty} \left\{b_{h+s+1} v^{s+2} ~_{s+1|} q_{x+h} -  P_{h+s+1} v^{s+1}  ~_{s+1} p_{x+h} \right\}\end{aligned}$$
where we have used $s=j-1$. Now, recall the relation
$~_{s+1} p_{x+h}= p_{x+h} ~_s p_{x+h+1}$ and $$\begin{aligned}
~_{s+1|} q_{x+h} &= ~_{s+1} p_{x+h} q_{x+h+s+1} \\
&= p_{x+h} ~_s p_{x+h+1} q_{x+h+s+1} = p_{x+h} ~_{s|} q_{x+h+1}\end{aligned}$$
With this, we have $$\begin{aligned}
~_h V &=  b_{h+1} v  q_{x+h} - P_h+
vp_{x+h} \sum_{s=0}^{\infty} \left\{b_{h+1+s} v^{s+1} ~_{s|} q_{x+h+1} -  P_{h+1+s} v^s  ~_s p_{x+h+1} \right\} \\
&=  b_{h+1} v  q_{x+h} - P_h+ vp_{x+h} ~_{h+1} V.\end{aligned}$$ Put
another way, we can express this as

  --------------- ---------------------------- -----------------------
   $~_h V + P_h$     $= v  q_{x+h} b_{h+1}$     $+vp_{x+h} ~_{h+1} V$
   policy value    is sufficient to provide a   plus the policy value
   plus premium      death benefit for the       for the proportion
                     proportion that fails          that survives
  --------------- ---------------------------- -----------------------

**Special Case.** Consider a single pay whole life insurance so that
$b_h=1$, $P_0 = A_x$, $P_h = 0$ for $h\ge 1$, and $~_h V = A_{x+h}$.
Then, for $h=0$, $$\begin{aligned}
A_x = v  q_{x+1} +vp_{x+1} A_{x+1} .\end{aligned}$$ For $h\ge 1$,
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{x+h}  = v  q_{x+h} +vp_{x+h} A_{x+h+1} .\end{aligned}$$ This is our
familiar recursive insurance form.

**Example.** Consider a special fully discrete 10- year endowment policy
to (30). Level premiums are payable for 10 years. The maturity value is
1 and a level $i=6\%$ interest is assumed. For simplicity, mortality is
given as $~_k p_{30} = 0.98^k$. The death benefit is 1 plus the policy
value. Calculate $~_3 V$.

*Solution.*

Using the recursive reserve formulation, we have $$\begin{aligned}
(1.06)(~_h V + P) &=  b_{h+1}  q_{x+h} + p_{x+h} ~_{h+1} V\\
&= (1+ ~_{h+1} V)  q_{x+h} + p_{x+h} ~_{h+1} V = 0.02 + ~_{h+1} V\end{aligned}$$
because $q_{x+h}=1-p_{x+h}=1- \frac{~_{h+1} p_x}{~ _h p_x} = 0.02$. We
re-write this as $$\begin{aligned}
1.06 ~_h V - ~_{h+1} V  &=   q_{x+h} - 1.06 P\end{aligned}$$
Multiplying each side by $v^{h+1}$ yields $$\begin{aligned}
v^h ~_h V - v^{h+1} ~_{h+1} V  &=  v^{h+1} q_{x+h} - v^h P .\end{aligned}$$
Summing both sides over $h=0, \ldots, 9$ yields $$\begin{aligned}
v^0 ~_0 V - v^{10} ~_{10} V  &= \sum_{h=0}^9 \left( v^{h+1} q_{x+h} - v^h P \right)\\
&= (v(0.02) - 1.06 P) \ddot{a}_{\overline{10|}} .\end{aligned}$$
Because $~_0 V=0$ and $~_{10} V =1$, we have $$\begin{aligned}
P &= \frac{v^{10}}{\ddot{a}_{\overline{10|}}} +0.02 v = 0.09044 .\end{aligned}$$

## Expense Augmented Policy Values {#S:ExpenseAugment}

We now add expenses to our benefit premiums ($P$) and call them expense
augmented premiums ($G$, for “gross premiums”). In practice, there are
several additional layers before $G$ is quoted to the public, for
example, dividends for participating policies, profit loadings for
nonparticipating policies, impact of nonforfeiture benefits, effects of
competition, and so on.

Expense rates vary significantly by company. Larger companies generally
have lower expense rates but not as much as economies of scale would
suggest. Expenses are usually broadly classified as insurance or
investment expenditures. The latter are expressed as a percentage of
return and thus, we use $i = 6\%$ in lieu of $6.5\%$ in our calculations
($1/2\%$ for expenses). The former are classified by line of business
(for example, ordinary versus group, life versus annuity, and so forth).

The units of expense enter our calculations as:

-   per policy

-   percentage of premiums

-   per \$1,000 death benefit (policy size)

-   per claim (may vary by lapse, surrender, maturity).

premiums. Benefits are payable immediately. Use the Illustrative
Mortality Table with $i=6\% $.

a\) Provide an expression for the gross future loss random variable.

b\) Calculate the expense-augment (gross) annual premium.

*Solution.*

  &= 2000 + (0.843278) G .\end{aligned}$$ Now, setting (i)+(iii)=(ii),
we have $$\begin{aligned}
G &= \frac{29,873.20 +2,000}{14.73113 - 0.843278} = 2,295.05 .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Example.** For a fully discrete whole life insurance of 100,000 on
(x), you are given: (i) Expenses, paid at the beginning of the year, are
as follows:

[l|ccc]{}\
& Percentage of & Per 1000 & Per Policy\
Year & Premium Expenses & Expenses & Expenses\
First Year & 50%&2.0& 150\
2+ & 4% & 0.5 & 25\

\(ii) $i = 0.04$ (iii) $\ddot{a}_x =10.8$.

Calculate the expense-loaded premium using the equivalence principle.

*Solution.*

EPV Premium = $G \ddot{a}_x = G (10.8)$

EPV Benefit = $100000 A_x$

EPV Expenses $$\begin{aligned}
&= 0.5 G + 200 + 150
+ (0.04 G + 50 + 25) a_x \\
&= G (0.5 +0.04 a_x) + 350 + 75 a_x = G (0.892) + 1,085 .\end{aligned}$$
Equating EPV Premium = EPV Benefit + EPV Expenses yields
$$\begin{aligned}
10.8 G &= 100000 A_x + 0.892 G + 1085 .\end{aligned}$$ Solving for G
yields $$\begin{aligned}
G &= \frac{100000 A_x + 1085}{10.8 - 0.892} = \frac{58462  1085}{9.908} = 6009.99 .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Example.** Consider at 10-year term life policy for \$ 100,000 to a
life age (30). Benefits are payable immediately, premiums are payable at
the beginning of the year. Use the Illustrative Mortality Table with
$i=6\% $. Expenses are according to the following schedule:

[l|ccc]{}\
& Per & Per \$1000 of & Percent of\
Type & Policy & Insurance& Premium\
First Year & \$50 & 5.00 & 82%\
Years 2-5 & 6 & 0.50 & 14.5\
Years 6-10 & 6 & 0.50 & 7.0\
Claim Settlement & 25 & 0.10\

Calculate $G$, the gross annual premium.

*Solution.*

$$\begin{aligned}
G \ddot{a}_{30:\overline{10|}}&=
 100,000 \bar{A}_{30:\overline{10|}}^{~1}
 + (25+100(0.10)) \bar{A}_{30:\overline{10|}}^{~1}
 + 550 \\

 + 0.145 G a_{30:\overline{4|}}
 + 0.07 G ~_{5|5} \ddot{a}_{30} .\end{aligned}$$

Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
G &=
\frac{100,035 \bar{A}_{30:\overline{10|}}^{~1}
 + 56 \ddot{a}_{30:\overline{10|}} + 494}
{0.93 \ddot{a}_{30:\overline{10|}} - 0.075
\ddot{a}_{30:\overline{5|}} - 0.675} \approx \$385.\end{aligned}$$

**Example - Follow-up**

-   Determine the net premium policy value at $t=5$.

-   Determine the gross premium policy value at $t=5$.

*Solution:* The net premium is $$\begin{aligned}
P &=
100000 \frac{ \bar{A}_{30:\overline{10|}}^{~1}}
{\ddot{a}_{30:\overline{10|}}} \approx \$189.\end{aligned}$$

The net premium policy value is $$\begin{aligned}
_5 V^n &= \mathrm{E~}PVFB - \mathrm{E~}PVFNP  = 100000  \bar{A}_{35:\overline{5|}}^{~1} -
P \ddot{a}_{35:\overline{5|}}  \approx \$144.\end{aligned}$$

The gross premium policy value is $$\begin{aligned}
_5 V^g &= \mathrm{E~}PVFB +\mathrm{E~}PVFE - \mathrm{E~}PVFGP \\
&= (100000 + 25 + 100 \times 0.1)  \bar{A}_{35:\overline{5|}}^{~1} \\

## Policy Values with Continuous Cash Flows

Let

-   $P_t$ be the annual rate of premium payable at time $t$

-   $e_t$ be the annual rate of premium-related expense payable at time
    $t$

-   $b_t$ be the benefit, or sum insured, payable at time $t$ for
    failure at time $t$

-   $E_t$ be the expense of paying the benefit at time $t$

-   $\mu_{[x]+t}$ be the force of mortality at age $[x]+t$

-   $\delta_t$ be the force of interest at time $t$

-   $v(t) = \exp\left(-\int_0^t \delta_s ds \right)$ is the present
    value (at time 0) of 1 at time $t$

-   $~_t V$ be the policy value at time $t$

At time $t$, the present value of future benefits is $$\begin{aligned}
PVFB_t &= \int_0^{\infty} b_{t+s} \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t}~ \mu_{[x]+t+s} ~ds,\end{aligned}$$
the present value of future expenses is $$\begin{aligned}
PVFE_t &= \int_0^{\infty} E_{t+s} \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t}~ \mu_{[x]+t+s} ~ds
+ \int_0^{\infty} e_{t+s} \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t} ~ds,\end{aligned}$$
and the present value of future premiums is $$\begin{aligned}
PVFP_t &=  \int_0^{\infty} P_{t+s} \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t} ~ds.\end{aligned}$$
Combining these, we have the policy value at time $t$ is
$$\begin{aligned}
~_t V &= PVFB_t + PVFE_t - PVFP_t \\
 &= \int_0^{\infty} (b_{t+s}+E_{t+s}) \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t}~ \mu_{[x]+t+s} ~ds \\
&~~~~~~-&  \int_0^{\infty} (P_{t+s}-e_{t+s}) \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t}~ ds\end{aligned}$$

**Example. Inflation Indexed Benefits and Premiums.** Consider a fully
continuous whole life insurance with both benefits and premiums indexed
to inflation rates. Specifically, for failure at policy time $t$, the
benefit payment is $b_t = b (1+r_b)^t$. Premiums also increased
continuously, with premium payment rate at time $t$ being
$P_t = P (1+r_P)^t$. Thus, we allow the premium rate increase ($r_P$) to
differ from the benefit rate increase ($r_b$). Assuming a constant force
of interest and no expenses, the policy value at time $t$ may be
expressed as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t V &=  \int_0^{\infty} b_{t+s} v^s ~_s p_{[x]+t} \mu_{[x]+t+s} ~ds -  \int_0^{\infty} P_{t+s} v^s ~_s p_{[x]+t} ~ds \\
&=  b (1+r_b)^t \int_0^{\infty} (1+r_b)^s v^s ~_s p_{[x]+t} ~\mu_{[x]+t+s} ~ds -  P (1+r_P)^t \int_0^{\infty} (1+r_P)^s v^s ~_s p_{[x]+t}~ ds \\
&=  b (1+r_b)^t \bar{A}_{[x]+t}^{b} -  P (1+r_P)^t\bar{a}_{[x]+t}^{P} ,\end{aligned}$$
where $\bar{A}_{[x]+t}^{b}$ is evaluated at discount rate
$v_b = (1+r_b)v$. This corresponds to a new force of interest
$\delta_b = - \ln v_b = - \ln (v(1+r_b)) = \delta - \ln(1+r_b)$.
Similarly, for $\bar{a}_{[x]+t}^{P}$, the new force of interest is
$\delta_P = \delta - \ln(1+r_P)$.

To illustrate, suppose that $i=6\%$, $r_b=3\%$, and $r_P= 1\%$. Then, we
would calculate policy values as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t V =  b (1.03)^t \bar{A}_{[x]+t}^{@i=2.92\%} -  P (1.01)^t \bar{a}_{[x]+t}^{@i=4.95\%} .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

To get an idea as to how policy values evolve over time, we write the
policy value at time $t$ in a single equation as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t V &=  \int_0^{\infty}
 \left\{ (b_{t+s}+E_{t+s})\mu_{[x]+t+s} - (P_{t+s}-e_{t+s})
 \right\}
  \frac{v(t+s)}{v(t)} ~_s p_{[x]+t}  ds \\
 &= \int_t^{\infty}
 \left\{ (b_r+E_r)\mu_{[x]+r} - (P_r-e_r) \right\}
  \frac{v(r)}{v(t)} \frac{~_r p_{[x]}}{~_t p_{[x]}}  ~dr\end{aligned}$$

using $r=t+s$ and the relation
$~_{r-t} p_{[x]+t}=\frac{~_r p_{[x]}}{~_t p_{[x]}}$. This yields
$$\begin{aligned}
v(t) ~_t p_{[x]} ~_t V
 &= \int_t^{\infty} \left\{ (b_r+E_r)\mu_{[x]+r} - (P_r-e_r) \right\} v(r) ~_r p_{[x]}  dr\end{aligned}$$
Now take a (partial) derivative with respect to $t$. On the right-hand
side, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}RHS &= - \left\{ (b_t+E_t)\mu_{[x]+t} - (P_t-e_t) \right\} v(t) ~_t p_{[x]}.\end{aligned}$$
On the left-hand side, by the chain-rule of differentiation (twice), we
have $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}LHS &=
v(t) ~_t p_{[x]} \left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}~_t V - (\delta_t + \mu_{[x]+t}) ~_t V \right\}.\end{aligned}$$
Equating both sides yields *Thiele’s differential equation*

[cccc]{}\
$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} ~_t V$ & $=P_t-e_t$

### Euler’s Method for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations

Wish to evaluate a generic function f($t$). Suppose we know a starting
value, for example, f(0) = $c$. We also know that we can express
f($\cdot$) through the ordinary differential equation $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \textrm{f}(t) = \textrm{g}(\textrm{f}(t)),\end{aligned}$$
where $\textrm{g}(\cdot)$ is a known function. Occasionally, we can
solve the ordinary differential equation analytically. More often, a
numerical solution is available. The easiest to explain and to implement
is Euler’s method. To see this, consider a small $h$ and use a straight
line approximation for the derivative $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \textrm{f}(t) \approx \frac{\textrm{f}(t+h)-\textrm{f}(t)}{h}.\end{aligned}$$
With this, we have an approximation to the ordinary differential
equation $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{f}(t+h) \approx  \textrm{f}(t) + h \textrm{g}(\textrm{f}(t))\end{aligned}$$
that we can evaluate recursively.

**Example - Interest Theory**. Suppose that $\textrm{g}(t) = 0.05 t$, a
line, and f(0) = 1. Then, if $h=0.001$, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{f}(t+h) \approx  \textrm{f}(t) + (0.001) (0.05) \textrm{f}(t) .\end{aligned}$$

  $t$                               0          0.001          0.002          0.998          0.999              1

$\Box$

For this example, we can evaluate f($\cdot$) analytically, in that
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \textrm{f}(t) = 0.05 \textrm{f}(t)  \ \ \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ \ \ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ln \textrm{f}(t) = 0.05 ,\end{aligned}$$
and so that, with f(0) = 1, we have $\textrm{f}(t) = e^{0.05 t}$.

$\Box$

**Example - Whole Life**. Consider a whole life insurance to ($x$) with
a death benefit of 100,000 payable at the moment of failure that is paid
up immediately. Using a constant force of interest $\delta$ and assuming
no expenses, Thiele’s differential equation can be expressed as
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} ~_t V  = (\delta + \mu_{[x]+t}) ~_t V -(100,000)\mu_{[x]+t},\end{aligned}$$
because premiums $P_t = 0$ for $t>0$. In this case, the policy value can
be computed using Thiele’s differential equation or via numerical
integration because $$\begin{aligned}
~_t V  = 100,000 \bar{A}_{[x]+t} = 100,000 \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta s}  ~_s p_{[x]+t} ~ \mu_{[x]+t+s} ds .\end{aligned}$$
That is, because there are no future premiums, the policy value is
simply the expected present value of future benefits.

For mortality, we follow DHW and use the “Standard Ultimate Survival
Model,” so that $$\begin{aligned}
\mu_x = A + B c^x\end{aligned}$$ where $A = 0.00022$,
$B=2.7 \times 10^{-6}$, and $c=1.124$ for ultimate mortality. Using the
ordinary differential equation, we calculated the approximate policy
value using the recursive expression $$\begin{aligned}
100,000\bar{A}_{x+t+h} \approx  100,000\bar{A}_{x+t} + 0.001 \left((\ln(1.05) + \mu_{[x]+t}) (100,000)\bar{A}_{x+t} -(100,000)\mu_{[x]+t}\right),\end{aligned}$$
beginning with $100,000 \bar{A}_{40} = 12,404$ from the DHW text. The
following table is an excerpt of our results. The value for
$\bar{A}_{60}$ agrees with DHW (Table 4.3, page 86).

## Retrospective Policy Values

**General Discrete Policy.** For a general discrete policy, we have
(known) premiums $P_h$ payable at time $h$ and benefits payable at time
$b_h$. As we have seen in Section \[S:Recursive\], the policy value can
be expressed recursively as $$\begin{aligned}
~_h V  &=   v q_{x+h} b_{h+1} -  P_h + v p_{x+h} ~_{h+1} V.\end{aligned}$$
Now, multiply each side by $v^h ~_h p_x$ to get $$\begin{aligned}
v^h ~_h p_x  ~_h V  - v^{h+1} ~_h p_x ~ p_{x+h} ~_{h+1} V  &=   v^{h+1} ~_h p_x ~ q_{x+h} b_{h+1} -  P_h  v^h ~_h p_x\end{aligned}$$
Note the relations $~_{h+1} p_x=~_h p_x ~ p_{x+h}$ and
$~_{h|} q_x=~_h p_x ~ q_{x+h}$. Sum each side of the equation over
$h=0, \ldots, k-1$. On the left-hand side, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{h=0}^{k-1} \left\{v^h ~_h p_x  ~_h V  - v^{h+1} ~_{h+1} p_x ~_{h+1} V \right\} &=
v^0 ~_0 p_x  ~_0 V - v^k ~_k p_x ~_k V =  -  ~_k E_x ~_k V,\end{aligned}$$
recalling the relation $~_k E_x = v^k ~_k p_x$ and assuming that
$~_0 V=0$. On the right-hand side, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{h=0}^{k-1} \left\{v^{h+1} ~_{h|} q_x b_{h+1} -  P_h  ~ v^h ~_h p_x \right\} .\end{aligned}$$
Thus, we may write $$\begin{aligned}
~_k V &= \frac{\sum_{h=0}^{k-1} P_h  ~ v^h ~_h p_x }{ ~_k E_x}-
\frac{\sum_{h=0}^{k-1} v^{h+1} ~_{h|} q_x b_{h+1}  }{ ~_k E_x} \\
&= \textrm{Accumulated Value of Premium} - \textrm{Accumulated Cost of Insurance} .\end{aligned}$$

**Example.** For a fully discrete policy for $x$, the first year benefit
is 10,000 and the first year premium payable at the beginning of the
year is 500. Calculate the policy value at duration 1, assuming $i=5\%$
and $q_x = 0.03$.

*Solution.*

From the retrospective formula, we have $$\begin{aligned}
~_1 V &= \frac{\sum_{h=0}^0 P_h  v^h ~_h p_x }{ ~_1 E_x}-
\frac{\sum_{h=0}^0 v^{h+1} ~_{h|} q_x b_{h+1}  }{ ~_1 E_x} =
 \frac{P_0}{ ~_1 E_x}-
\frac{ v  q_x b_1  }{ ~_1 E_x} \\
&= \frac{500}{ v p_x}-
\frac{ v  q_x (10000)}{ v p_x} = \frac{500-10000\frac{1}{1.05}(0.03)}{\frac{1}{1.05} (1-0.03)} = 231.96 .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Application.** Consider two generic policies that have level premiums
$P_1$ and $P_2$ and policy values $~_k V_1$ and $~_k V_2$, respectively.
Suppose that they have the same accumulated cost of insurance, denoted
as $~_k AC_x$, at policy duration $k$. Then, from the retrospective
formula, we may express the difference in policy values as
$$\begin{aligned}
~_k V_1 - ~_k V_2 &= (P_1-P_2) \frac{\sum_{h=0}^{k-1}  v^h ~_h p_x }{ ~_k E_x}
= (P_1-P_2) \ddot{s}_{x:\overline{k|}}.\end{aligned}$$ Here, the
difference in accumulated values drops out because they are assumed
equivalent. Thus, the difference in policy values is a simple function
of the difference in premiums

**Example 1.** Suppose that Policy 1 is a traditional $n$-year endowment
policy and Policy 2 is a traditional $n$-year term life policy. Then, we
may write the excess policy value of the $n$-year endowment over the
$n$-year term as $$\begin{aligned}
~_k V_1 - ~_k V_2 &= (P_{x:\overline{n|}}-P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}) \ddot{s}_{x:\overline{k|}}.\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Example 2.** Suppose that Policy 1 is a traditional $n$-year endowment
policy and Policy 2 is a traditional $n$-pay whole life policy. Then, we
may write the excess premium of the $n$-year endowment over the $n$-pay
whole as $$\begin{aligned}
P_{x:\overline{n|}}- ~_n P_x &= \frac{1}{\ddot{s}_{x:\overline{h|}}}(~_k V_1 - ~_k V_2 ) \\
&= P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}(~_k V_1 - ~_k V_2 ) .\end{aligned}$$ In
particular, if we take $k=n$, then we get $$\begin{aligned}
P_{x:\overline{n|}}- ~_n P_x &= P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}(1 - A_{x+n} ) .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Exercise.** (a) Use the same logic to check the relation
$$\begin{aligned}
P_x  &= P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}+ P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}~_n V_x  ,\end{aligned}$$
where $~_n V_x$ is the policy value of a whole life policy at duration
$n$. (b) Suppose that $~_n V_x = 0.08$, $P_x =0.024$, and
$P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1} = 0.02$. Calculate $P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}$.

*Solution.* (a) Suppose that Policy 1 is a traditional whole life policy
and Policy 2 is a traditional $n$-year term life policy. Then, we may
write the excess policy value of the whole life over the term policy as
$$\begin{aligned}
~_k V_1 - ~_k V_2 &= (P_x -P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}) \ddot{s}_{x:\overline{k|}}.\end{aligned}$$
At duration $k=n$, the term policy has value 0 and the right-hand side
is $~_n V_x$. As before,
$1/\ddot{s}_{x:\overline{n|}} = P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}$, yielding the
desired result. (b) From part (a), we have $$\begin{aligned}
0.024 = P_x  &= P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}+ P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}~_n V_x = P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1} + (0.02)(0.08).\end{aligned}$$
This yields $P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1} = 0.008.$

## Policies with Discrete Cash Flows other than Annual

### Policy Valuation

Why other than annual? It is common to assume that benefits are payable
at the moment of failure and that premiums are payable at the beginning
of the $m$thly period (e.g., $m =2,$ or $4$).

Traditional actuarial symbols are based on discrete annual cash flows
because mortality rates are typically available annually.

The “UDD” assumption is the primary tool for developing survival
probabilities at other than annual intervals. Recall that this means
*uniform distribution of deaths* within a year. This is not the same as
the De Moivre assumption which is uniform over the lifetime of an
individual.

**UDD Assumption**.

Recall earlier relations. For a whole life policy with a benefit payable
at the end of the $m$thly period, the expected present value is
$$\begin{aligned}
A_x^{(m)} = \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} A_x,\end{aligned}$$ where $i^{(m)}$ is the
$m$thly nominal interest rate determined by
$1+i= \left(1+\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m$. Note that this is an $exact$
relationship under the UDD assumption. As $m \rightarrow \infty$, this
yields $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_x = \frac{i}{\delta} A_x .\end{aligned}$$ Further,
$$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_x^{(m)} = \alpha(m) \ddot{a}_x - \beta(m),\end{aligned}$$ where
$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha(m) = \frac{id}{i^{(m)} d^{(m)}} \textrm{    and    } \beta(m) = \frac{i-d}{i^{(m)} d^{(m)}},\end{aligned}$$
and $d^{(m)}$ is the $m$thly nominal discount rate determined by
$1-d= \left(1-\frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m$. As $m \rightarrow \infty$,
this yields $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_x^{(m)} = \alpha(\infty) \ddot{a}_x - \beta(\infty),\end{aligned}$$
where $$\begin{aligned}
\alpha(\infty) = \frac{id}{\delta^2} \textrm{    and    } \beta(\infty) = \frac{i-d}{\delta^2} .\end{aligned}$$
For approximations, we often use $$\begin{aligned}
\alpha(m) \approx 1 \textrm{    and    } \beta(m) \approx \frac{m-1}{2m} .\end{aligned}$$

With these assumptions and approximations, one can readily handle common
traditional policies.

**Special Case 1. $n$-year Endowment Policy** Insurance benefits payable
at the moment of failure and premiums payable at the beginning of the
year. In this case, the policy value at duration $k$ is
$$\begin{aligned}
~_k V  &= \bar{A}_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}} -
P(\bar{A}_{x:\overline{n|}}) \ddot{a}_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}} .\end{aligned}$$
To evaluate this, under UDD we have $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}} &=
\bar{A}_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}}^{~~1}
+A_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}}^{~~~~~~1} \\
&= \frac{i}{\delta} A_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}}^{~~1}
+A_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}}^{~~~~~~1}\end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned}
P(\bar{A}_{x:\overline{n|}})
=\frac{\bar{A}_{x:\overline{n|}}}{\ddot{a}_{x:\overline{n|}}}
&=
\frac{\frac{i}{\delta} A_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}
+A_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1} }{\ddot{a}_{x:\overline{n|}}}\\
&= \frac{i}{\delta}P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}
+P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1} .\end{aligned}$$ This yields
$$\begin{aligned}
~_k V   &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}}^{~~1}
+A_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}}^{~~~~~~1} - \left(
\frac{i}{\delta}P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1} +P_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}
\right) \ddot{a}_{x+k:\overline{n-k|}} \\
&= \frac{i}{\delta} ~_k V_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1} + ~_k
V_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1},\end{aligned}$$ where
$~_k V_{x:\overline{n|}}^{1}$ is the policy value at duration $k$ of an
$n$-year term policy and $~_k V_{x:\overline{n|}}^{~~1}$ is the policy
value at duration $k$ of an $n$-year pure endowment policy.

**Special Case 2. Whole Life Policy.** Benefits are payable at the end
of year of failure and premiums are payable at the beginning of the
$m$thly period. In this case, the policy value at duration $k$ is
$$\begin{aligned}
~_k V   &= A_{x+k} - P_x^{(m)} \ddot{a}_{x+k}^{(m)} .\end{aligned}$$
Let us denote the policy value for a traditional whole life policy (with
annual premiums) as $$\begin{aligned}
~_k V_x  &= A_{x+k} - P_x \ddot{a}_{x+k} = 1 - d\ddot{a}_{x+k}- P_x
\ddot{a}_{x+k} \\
&= 1- \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+k}}{\ddot{a}_x}.\end{aligned}$$ Then, we may
write the difference between these as $$\begin{aligned}
~_k V  - ~_k V_x  &= P_x \ddot{a}_{x+k} - P_x^{(m)}
\ddot{a}_{x+k}^{(m)} \\
&= \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x^{(m)}} \frac{\ddot{a}_x^{(m)}}{\ddot{a}_x}
 \ddot{a}_{x+k} - P_x^{(m)} \ddot{a}_{x+k}^{(m)} \\
 &= P_x^{(m)} \frac{\alpha(m)\ddot{a}_x - \beta(m)}{\ddot{a}_x}
 \ddot{a}_{x+k} - P_x^{(m)} (\alpha(m)\ddot{a}_{x+k}-\beta(m)) \\
&= P_x^{(m)} \left( \frac{ - \beta(m)}{\ddot{a}_x}
 \ddot{a}_{x+k} -  (-\beta(m))  \right) \\
 &= P_x^{(m)}\beta(m) \left(
 1- \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+k}}{\ddot{a}_x}  \right) = P_x^{(m)}\beta(m) ~_k V_x .\\\end{aligned}$$
We think about the $m$thly premium policy value as equal to the policy
value for a traditional (annual premium) policy plus a reserve on an
auxiliary policy to cover the premium loss in the year of death.

**Example. Whole Life Policy.** You are given $i=6\%$,
$\ddot{a}_{65} = 9.9,$ and $\ddot{a}_{70} = 8.8.$ Assuming UDD,
calculate the policy value for a whole life policy issued to a life (65)
at duration $k=5$, assuming that premiums are payable at the beginning
of each month.

*Solution.*

The policy value is $$\begin{aligned}
~_5 V &= A_{70} - P_{65}^{(12)} \ddot{a}_{70}^{(12)} .\end{aligned}$$
The whole life insurance net single premium is $$\begin{aligned}
A_{70} = 1-d\ddot{a}_{70} = 1- \frac{0.06}{1.06} 8.8 = 0.501886792.\end{aligned}$$
To calculate the monthly annuities, we first need the interest factors.
With $1.06 = (1+\frac{i^{(12)}}{12})^{12},$ we have
$i^{(12)}= 0.058410607.$ With
$1-\frac{0.06}{1.06}=1-d = (1-\frac{d^{(12)}}{12})^{12},$ we have
$d^{(12)}= 0.058127667.$ This yields $$\begin{aligned}
\alpha(12) = \frac{id}{i^{(12)} d^{(12)}}=\frac{0.06 \frac{0.06}{1.06}}{(0.058410607) (0.058127667)} =1.000281005,\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
\beta(12) = \frac{i-d}{i^{(12)} d^{(12)}}= \frac{0.06-\frac{0.06}{1.06}}{(0.058410607) (0.058127667)}=0.46811951.\end{aligned}$$
Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{70}^{(12)} = \alpha(12) \ddot{a}_{70} - \beta(12) = (1.000281005)8.8-0.46811951=8.334353338.\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
P_{65}^{(12)} &= \frac{A_{65}}{\ddot{a}_{65}^{(12)}} =
\frac{1-d\ddot{a}_{65}}
{ \alpha(12) \ddot{a}_{65} - \beta(12)}\\
&=
\frac{1-\frac{0.06}{1.06} 9.9}{
(1.000281005)9.9-0.46811951}=0.046596542.\end{aligned}$$ With this, the
policy value is $$\begin{aligned}
~_5 V  &= A_{70} - P_{65}^{(12)} \ddot{a}_{70}^{(12)} = 0.501886792 - (0.046596542) 8.334353338= 0.11353475
.\end{aligned}$$

### Policy Values at Fractional Durations

An insurance company takes on contracts continuously throughout the year
yet has a single valuation date (e.g., 1 July 20xx). Thus, even for
traditional policies with annual cash flows, one needs the policy value
when the duration includes a fraction of a year. Of course, for a fully
continuous policy value, no special adjustments need be made.

TimeLine Here.

Let $k$ denote the integer duration time and $s$ denote the fractional
time, so that $0<s<1$ and the duration time is $k+s$. For a fully
discrete policy, as we have seen in Section \[S:Recursive\], the policy
value can be expressed recursively as $$\begin{aligned}
~_k V  &=   v q_{x+k} b_{k+1} - P_k + v p_{x+k} ~_{k+1} V .\end{aligned}$$
Now, for $0<s<1$, we define the policy value at fractional duration to
be $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+s} V  &=   v^{1-s} ~_{1-s} q_{x+k+s} ~b_{k+1}  + v^{1-s} ~_{1-s} p_{x+k+s}  ~_{k+1} V .\end{aligned}$$
To evaluate this, under UDD we have $$\begin{aligned}
~_{1-s} q_{x+k+s}  &= \frac{(1-s) q_{x+k}}{1- s \times q_{x+k}}\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
~_{1-s} p_{x+k+s}  &= \frac{p_{x+k}}{1- s \times q_{x+k}} .\end{aligned}$$
Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k+s} V  &=   \frac{v^{1-s}}{1- s \times q_{x+k}}
\left( (1-s) \left\{q_{x+k} b_{k+1}\right\}   +  p_{x+k}  ~_{k+1} V \right) \\
&=   \frac{v^{1-s}}{1- s \times q_{x+k}}
\left( (1-s)\left\{ (P_k +~_k V)(1+i) - p_{x+k}  ~_{k+1} V
\right\}  +  p_{x+k}  ~V_{k+1} \right) \\
&=   \frac{v^{1-s}}{1- s \times q_{x+k}}
\left( (1-s) (1+i)(P_k +~_k V) +s \times  p_{x+k}  ~_{k+1} V \right) \\
&\approx &
(1-s) (P_k +~_k V) +s \times  ~_{k+1} V .\end{aligned}$$ This
approximation assumes a small mortality rate so that $q_{x+k} \approx 0$
and small interest rate so that $v^{-s} \approx 1.$

It is common to write this approximation as

  --------------- ------------------------------- -------------------
   $~_{k+s} V =$    $(1-s)~_k V +s  ~_{k+1} V$       + $(1-s) P_k$
      reserve      interpolate terminal reserves   unearned premiums
  --------------- ------------------------------- -------------------

where $~_k V, ~_{k+1} V$ are known as “terminal reserves” and
$(1-s) P_k$ is that portion of the annual premium that has been
collected but “not earned’ by the valuation date.

**Example.** (Act Mat, p. 219) Consider a 5-year term policy to (50)
with $P = 1000 P_{50:\overline{5|}}^{~1} = 6.55692$, $~_2 V = 1.64$, and
$~_3 V = 1.73$. Then, we may compute the policy value at duration
$k+s=2.25$ as $$\begin{aligned}
~_{2+0.25} V  &\approx &
(1-0.25) (P_2 +~_2 V ) +0.25 \times  ~_3 V  \\
&=  (1-0.25) (P6.55692 +1.64) +0.25 \times 1.73 = 6.58 .\end{aligned}$$
For policies values at other fractional durations, see **Figure xxx**

**Don’t know about fractional duration reserves for mthly policies. Hold
for now.**
