# Single Lifetime Distribution Essentials

## The Lifetime Random Variable, $X$

We begin by considering a non-negative random variable, $X$. Typically,
we think of $X$ as the age at death of a newborn child. We summarize the
distribution of $X$ using the *distribution function* $$\begin{aligned}
F(x)&=\Pr(X \le x)\\\end{aligned}$$ and the *survival function*
$$\begin{aligned}
S(x)&= 1-F(x) = \Pr(X>x).\\\end{aligned}$$ Recall the **defining
properties of a distribution function**:

1.  $F(-\infty)= \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} F(x) = 0$

2.  $F(\infty)= \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} F(x)  =1$

3.  $F(x)$ is nondecreasing in $x$.

**Example - A Distribution due to Makeham (1860).** This lifetime
distribution provides a pleasant balance between complexity and
practicality. It is more complex than simpler alternatives, such as the
exponential distribution or a distribution due to Gompertz. Nonetheless,
it can be (and is) used for selected actuarial applications.

One way to define the distribution is through the distribution function,
given as $$\begin{aligned}
F(x)&=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & x<0 \\
1 - \exp\left(-Ax-m(c^x-1)\right) &  x \ge 0
\end{array}
\right.\end{aligned}$$ Here, $A$ and $m$ and $c$ are parameters that the
analyst may specify to approximate experience under consideration.

Both distribution and survival functions are bounded below by zero and
above by one. Thus, we will not always write out the function over the
entire domain, using these bounds to give implicit results. For
examples, instead of writing out the function for $x<0$ and for
$x \ge 0$, we will write $$\begin{aligned}
S(x)&=\exp\left(-Ax-m(c^x-1)\right) .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

We begin with the distribution and survival functions because they
summarize the distribution for any random variable. To summarize the
distribution for *discrete* random variables, use the *probability mass
function* (*pmf*). For example, for a uniform distribution on the
integers from 1 to 100, we have, $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr(X=x) = \frac{1}{100} & x=1,2,\ldots, 99,100.\\\end{aligned}$$ To
summarize the distribution for *continuous* random variables, use the
*probability density function* (*pdf*), defined as $$\begin{aligned}
f(x) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}F(x)=F^\prime (x) .\\\end{aligned}$$
For non-negative random variables, we also use the *force of mortality*
(also known as the *hazard rate* or *failure rate*) $$\begin{aligned}
\mu(x)\equiv\frac{f(x)}{S(x)}=\frac{f(x)}{1-F(x)},\\\end{aligned}$$ to
summarize the distribution.

**Example - Makeham Distribution - continued.** The probability density
function can be calculated using $f(x)=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} F(x)$. However, for this distribution the
form is not intuitively appealing.

Instead, we examine the force of mortality using the relation
$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(x)& = \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}F(x)}{1-F(x)}
=-\frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}S(x)}{S(x)}= -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\ln(S(x)) .\\\end{aligned}$$
For the Makeham distribution, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\mu(x)& =  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\ln(S(x)) \\
& =  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (-Ax - m (c^x-1)) \\
& =   A + m c^x (\ln c)  =  A + B c^x ,\end{aligned}$$ where
$B = m \ln c$.

**Interpretation of the Force of Mortality**. The force of mortality
(*fom*) is the probability that a life aged $x$ fails in a tiny
interval, per unit of time. See the following calculations:
$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(x)&=\frac{f(x)}{1-F(x)}=\lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0}\frac{ \frac{F(x+\epsilon)-F(x)}{\epsilon}}{1-F(x)}\\
&=\lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0} \frac{\Pr(x<X\le x+\epsilon)}{\epsilon \: \Pr(X>x)}\\
&=\lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0} \frac{\Pr(x<X\le x+\epsilon |X>x)}{\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$

To relate the force of mortality to the survival function, we begin with
the relation $\mu(x)= -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\ln(S(x)).$
Integrating both sides, we have $$\begin{aligned}
S(y)=\exp \left\{ -\int_0^{y}\mu(x)\:dx \right\},\\\end{aligned}$$
assuming $S(0)=1$, or $F(0)=0$. This gives us a method to recover the
survival function using the force of mortality.

## The Future Remaining Lifetime, $T$

Recall that $X$ is the age at death of an individual. Now we suppose
that the individual survives to age $x$. Later, this will be the age at
which the individual purchases an insurance contract. At age $x$, the
individual’s future remaining lifetime is $$\begin{aligned}
T=T(x)=X-x .\end{aligned}$$

### Summarizing the Distribution of $T$

To discuss the distribution of $T$, we condition on the event
$\{X \ge x \} = \{T\ge 0\}$. Motivation, for individuals who do not
survive to age $x$, they do not purchase an insurance contract and so
are not under consideration here. Recall:

**Conditional Probabilities**. Let $A$ and $B$ be two generic events.
Define the conditional probability $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr(B|A)=\frac{\Pr(A\:\textrm{and}\:B)}{\Pr(A)} .\end{aligned}$$

**Example - Uniform Distribution - continued.** Suppose that
$X \sim \text{U}(0,100)$ and that $x=30$. The distribution function of
$T=T(30) = X-30$ is $$\begin{aligned}
F_x(t)=\Pr(T\le t)&=\Pr(X-30\le t| X\ge30)=\frac{\Pr(30\le X\le 30+t)}{\Pr(X\ge 30)}\\
&=\frac{\frac{30+t-30}{100}}{1-\frac{30}{100}}=\frac{t}{70}\Rightarrow T\sim \text{U(0,70)}. \\\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

In general, the distribution function of $T$ is $$\begin{aligned}
F_x(t)=\Pr(T\le t)&=\Pr(T\le t|T\ge 0)=\Pr(X\le x+t|X\ge x)=\frac{\Pr(x<X\le x+t)}{\Pr(X\ge x)}\\
&=\frac{F(x+t)-F(x)}{1-F(x)}=1-\frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)} .\end{aligned}$$
That is, the distribution function $F_x(\cdot)$ is a conditional
distribution function in terms of the random variable $X$, where one
conditions on survival to age $x$.

Similarly, the survival function of $T$ is $$\begin{aligned}
S_x(t)=1-F_x(t)=\Pr(T>t|T \ge 0)=\frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)} .\end{aligned}$$

### Actuarial Notation

We write the distribution function as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t q_x= F_x(t),
 \end{aligned}$$ and interpret this to mean “the probability a life aged
$(x)$ will die within $t$ years”.

We write the survival function as $$\begin{aligned}
~_tp_x= S_x(t) = 1-  F_x(t) =1- ~_t q_x
 \end{aligned}$$ and interpret this to mean “the probability a life aged
$(x)$ will survive $t$ years”.

The probability density function of $T$ is $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} F_x(t)&=&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(1-\frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)}\right)
=-\frac{S^{\prime} (x+t)}{S(x+t)}\frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)} \\
&=& \mu_{x+t}~_tp_x\\\end{aligned}$$ The force of mortality of $T$ is\
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text{p.d.f.}}{\text{s.f.}}&=&\frac{~_tp_x\:\mu_{x+t}}{~_tp_x}=\mu_{x+t}\end{aligned}$$
This is the force of mortality of $x$ at time $t$, corresponding to age
$x+t$.

Note that this the same as force of mortality for the random variable
$X$ but evaluated at time $t$, corresponding to age $x+t$.

**Example - Uniform Distribution - Summary.** Suppose that
$X \sim \text{U}(0,\omega)$. The (unconditional) distribution and
survivor functions of $X$ are: $$\begin{aligned}
F(x)&=&
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{x}{\omega} & 0\le x \le \omega\\
1 & 0> \omega \\
\end{array}
\right.\\
S(x)&=&1-\frac{x}{\omega}=\frac{\omega-x}{\omega} .\end{aligned}$$ The
survivor and distribution functions of $T$ (conditional on survivorship
to age $x$) are: $$\begin{aligned}
~_tp_x&=&\frac{S(x+1)}{S(x)}=\frac{\frac{\omega-(x+1)}{\omega}}{\frac{\omega-x}{\omega}}=1-\frac{t}{\omega-x}\\
&&0\le t\le\omega-x \:\:\:\:\:\:\text{uniform(0,$\omega-x$)}\\
~_tq_x&=&\frac{t}{\omega-x}\end{aligned}$$ The force of mortality is
$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_x&=&\frac{f(x)}{1-F(x)}=\frac{\frac{1}{\omega}}{1-\frac{x}{\omega}}=\frac{1}{\omega-x}.\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Example - Makeham Distribution - Summary.** Suppose that $X$ has a
Makeham distribution with parameters $A$, $m$ and $c$. Recall that the
survival function of $X$ is $$\begin{aligned}
S(x)&=&\exp\left(-Ax-m(c^x-1)\right) .\end{aligned}$$ and the force of
mortality is $\mu(x)=A + B c^x$, where $B = m \ln c$.

The survival function of $T$ (conditional on survivorship to age $x$) is
$$\begin{aligned}
~_tp_x&=\frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)}=
\frac{\exp\left(-A(x+t)-m(c^{x+t}-1)\right)}{\exp\left(-Ax-m(c^x-1)\right)} \\
&=\exp\left(-A t-mc^x(c^{t}-1)\right) .\end{aligned}$$ Note that you
can think of this conditional survival function as having the same form
as the original Makeham survival distribution with the parameter $m$
replaced by $mc^x$.

$\Box$

### Successive Conditioning

From the definition of the conditional survival function, we may write
$$\begin{aligned}
S(x+t) = S(x) \times S_x(t) .\end{aligned}$$ On the left-hand side, this
is the probability that a person age (0) survives $x+t$ years. On the
right-hand side, the first term is the probability that a person age (0)
survives $x$ years. The second term is the probability that a person age
($x$) survives an additional $t$ years. In actuarial notation, we may
express this as $$\begin{aligned}
~_{x+t} p_0 =  ~_x p_0  \times ~_t p_x .\end{aligned}$$

An immediate extension of this idea is $$\begin{aligned}
~_{r+t} p_x =  ~_r p_x  \times ~_t p_{x+r} .\end{aligned}$$ To check
this, simply write down the definition of each actuarial symbol
$$\begin{aligned}
 S_x(r+t) =  S_x(r)  \times S_{x+r}(t)\end{aligned}$$ which is
$$\begin{aligned}
 \frac{S(x+r+t)}{S(x)} =   \frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)}   \times  \frac{S(x+r+t)}{S(x+t)}\end{aligned}$$
that immediately establishes the relationship.

We interpret the relation $~_{r+t} p_x =  ~_r p_x  ~_t p_{x+r} $ to mean
that “the probability that a person age ($x$) survives an additional
$r+t$ years” equals “the probability that a person age ($x$) survives an
additional $r$ years” times “the probability that a person age ($x+r$)
survives an additional $t$ years.”

Note that the choices of $t, r,$ and $x$ depend on the problem. For
example, you may wish to evaluate $~_{15} p_{30}$ as
$~_{5} p_{30} ~_{10} p_{35}$ or as $~_{10} p_{30} ~_5 p_{40}$, depending
on the problem. Further, in some applications, it is useful to the use
the successive conditioning recursively. For example, we might write
$$\begin{aligned}
~_{15} p_{30} = p_{30} \times p_{31} \times \cdots \times p_{44} .\end{aligned}$$

## The Curtate Future Remaining Lifetime, $K$

Define $K=K(x)=$ greatest integer $\le T$, sometimes denoted as int($T$)
or $[T]$. This is called the *curtate* future remaining lifetime. It is
a discrete random variable and so we can discuss the probability mass
function $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr(K=k)&=&\Pr(k\le T<k+1)=~_kp_x-~_{k+1}p_x\\
&=&~_kp_x\: q_{x+k}=~_{k|}q_x\\\end{aligned}$$ In this expression, we
used successive conditioning to write $~_{k+1}p_x = ~_k p_x ~ p_{x+k}$ .

*Important.* Note that we are still calculating the distribution
function conditional on survivorship to age $x$. We could emphasize by
writing $\Pr(K=k | K \ge 0)= \Pr(k\le T<k+1 |T \ge 0)$.

Read the notation $~_{k|}q_x$ to mean “ the probability a life aged $x$
dies within one year, *deferred* by $k$ years”. So, we define the
**actuarial notation** $$\begin{aligned}
~_{k|n}q_x&=&\Pr(x+k \le T<x+k+n|T>0)\\
&=&\frac{S(x+k)-S(x+k+n)}{S(x)}=~_k p_x\:~_n q_{x+k}\end{aligned}$$ This
is the probability a life aged $x$ survives $k$ years to age $x+k$ and
then dies within $n$ years.

# Classic Joint Life Fundamentals

## Joint Life Fundamentals

We consider two lives who are ages $x$ and $y$, respectively, at
contract initiation. The future remaining lifetimes are $T(x)$ and
$T(y)$ at contract initiation. To aid with interpretation, we think of
“$x$” has the “insured’s” and “$y$” as the “spouse’s” age because many
joint life contracts are sold to married couples (although the theory
clearly applies to many other situations of interest, e.g., an insured
with a grandchild).

We are interested in known functions of these future remaining lifetimes
(e.g., “g”), $g(T(x), T(y))$; these functions are known as a $status$.
Here are the two most important examples:

**Joint Life Status**. In this case, the interest is in
$g(T(x), T(y))= \min(T(x), T(y)) = T(xy)$, which is the time until the
first of the two lives fails.

**Last Survivor Status**. In this case, the interest is in
$g(T(x), T(y))= \max(T(x), T(y)) = T(\overline{xy})$, which is the time
until the second of the two lives fails.

![image](Figures\JL_JointLifeTimeline.pdf){width=".75\textwidth"}

To warm up, start by assuming that $T(x)$ and $T(y)$ are independent.

### Joint-Life Probability Functions

The distribution function of $T=T(xy)$ is $$\begin{aligned}
F_T(t) &=& \Pr(T(xy) \leq t)= \Pr(\min(T(x), T(y)) \leq t) = 1- \Pr(\min(T(x), T(y)) > t) \\
&=& 1- \Pr(T(x) > t) \Pr(T(y) > t) = 1 - ~_t p_x \times ~_t p_y .\end{aligned}$$
We write the survivor function as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{xy} = 1 - F_T(t) = ~_t p_x \times ~_t p_y .\end{aligned}$$ From
this, the density function is $$\begin{aligned}
f_T(t) &=& F^{\prime}_T(t) = - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (~_t p_x \times ~_t p_y) \\
&=& - \left( ~_t p_x \frac{\partial}{\partial t} ~_t p_y +
~_t p_y \frac{\partial}{\partial t} ~_t p_x \right) \\
&=&   ~_t p_x ( ~_t p_y \mu_{y+t} )+
~_t p_y (~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} ) \\
&=&   ~_t p_x  ~_t p_y  (\mu_{x+t}+\mu_{y+t}) .\end{aligned}$$ Thus, the
force of mortality is $$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{xy}(t) = \frac{f_T(t)}{1-F_T(t)} = \mu_{x+t}+\mu_{y+t} .\end{aligned}$$

### Last-Survivor Probability Functions

The distribution function is $$\begin{aligned}
F_T(t) &=& \Pr(T(\overline{xy}) \leq t)=  \Pr(\max(T(x), T(y)) \leq t) =  \Pr(T(x) \leq t, T(y) \leq t)\\
&=_{IND}&  \Pr(T(x) \leq t)\Pr(T(y) \leq t)= ~_t q_x  ~_t q_x=(1 - ~_t p_x) \times (1- ~_t p_y) .\end{aligned}$$
We write the survivor function as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{\overline{xy}} = 1 - F_T(t) =~_t p_x + ~_t p_y - ~_t p_x ~ ~_t p_y .\end{aligned}$$
From this, the density function is $$\begin{aligned}
f_T(t) &=& F^{\prime}_T(t) = - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (~_t p_x + ~_t p_y - ~_t p_x ~ ~_t p_y) \\
&=&
~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} + ~_t p_y \mu_{y+t} -
 ~_t p_x  ~_t p_y  (\mu_{x+t}+\mu_{y+t}) \\
 &=& ~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} ~_t q_y +
~_t p_y \mu_{y+t} ~_t q_x  .\end{aligned}$$ Thus, the force of mortality
$\mu_{\overline{xy}}(t) = \frac{f_T(t)}{1-F_T(t)}$ does not have a
straightforward expression.

### Examples

**1.** Suppose that $T(x)$ is uniformly distributed (DeMoivre) over
$(0,w_x-x)$, $T(y)$ is uniformly distributed over $(0,w_y-y)$, and that
$T(x)$ and $T(y)$ are independent. Let $w_x=100$, $x=30$, $w_y=110$, and
$y=28$.

Determine: a) $~_{20} p_{30:28}$ b) $\mu_{30:28}(20)$ c)
$~_{20} p_{\overline{30:28}}$

*Solution.*

a\) For $T(x) \sim U(0,w_x-x)$ (DeMoivre), recall that $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_x = 1 -\frac{t}{w_x-x},  ~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} = \frac{1}{w_x-x}, \textrm{~and~} \mu_{x+t} = \frac{1}{w_x-x-t}.\end{aligned}$$
Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
~_{20} p_{30:28} &=& ~_{20} p_{30}^m ~_{20} p_{28}^f = \left(1-\frac{20}{100-30}\right)
\left(1-\frac{20}{110-28}\right) = 0.54.\end{aligned}$$ b)
$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{30:28}(20) = \mu_{30+20}^m + \mu_{28+20}(20)^f = \frac{1}{100-50}+\frac{1}{110-48} = 0.0361\end{aligned}$$
c) $$\begin{aligned}
~_{20} p_{\overline{30:28}} & =&
~_{20} p_{30}^m + ~_{20} p_{28}^f - ~_{20} p_{30:28} \\
& =& \frac{50}{70} + \frac{62}{82} - 0.54 = 0.930\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**2.** Suppose that $T(x)$ is exponentially distributed with force of
mortality $\mu_x(t)=\mu_1=0.02$, $T(y)$ is exponentially distributed
with force of mortality $\mu_y(t)=\mu_2=0.015$, and that $T(x)$ and
$T(y)$ are independent.

Provide expressions for: a) $~_t p_{xy}$ b) $\mu_{xy}(t)$ c)
$~_t p_{\overline{xy}}$

*Solution.*

a\) For $T(x)$ is exponentially distributed with force of mortality
$\mu_x(t)=\mu_1$, recall that $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_x = \exp(-\mu_1 t).\end{aligned}$$ Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{xy} = ~_t p_x \times ~_t p_y = \exp(-\mu_1 t)\exp(-\mu_2 t) = \exp(-(0.02+0.15)t) = \exp(-0.035 t).\end{aligned}$$
b) $$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{xy}(t) = \mu_{x}(t)^m+\mu_{y}(t)^f = \mu_1 +\mu_2 = 0.035.\end{aligned}$$
c) $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{\overline{xy}} &=& ~_t p_x + ~_t p_y - ~_t p_x ~ ~_t p_y \\
&=& \exp(-\mu_1 t) + \exp(-\mu_2 t) - \exp(-(\mu_1+\mu_2) t) \\
&=& \exp(-0.02 t) + \exp(-0.015 t) - \exp(-0.035 t) .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**3.** Recall that we can express the Gompertz force of mortality as
$\mu_x = B c^x$. In this case, we may express the survival function as
$S(x) = \exp(-m(c^x-1))$, where $m=B/ \ln c$ and the conditional
survivor function for $T(x)$ as $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_x = \exp(-m(c^{x+t}-c^x))= \exp(-m c^x(c^t-1)) .\end{aligned}$$
Assume that the Gompertz force governs mortality for males and females
(with a common parameters $m$ and $c$).

Determine the value of $w$ so that we may write $~_t p_{xy} = ~_t p_w$.
That is, show that we can compute joint life probabilities using a
single life table for the Gompertz case.

*Solution.*

The joint life survival probability is $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{xy} &=&  ~_t p_x \times ~_t p_y \\
&=&  \exp(-m c^x(c^t-1)) \exp(-m c^y(c^t-1))\\
 &=&  \exp(-( c^x + c^y) \times m (c^t-1))  \\\end{aligned}$$ So, define
$w$ to be the solution of $c^w = c^x + c^y$. With this, we may write
$$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{xy} &=& \exp(-( c^x + c^y) \times m (c^t-1)) =\exp(- m c^w (c^t-1))= ~_t p_w,  \\\end{aligned}$$
as required.

### Relating Status Distributions

It is possible to relate the joint life and last-survivor status without
the assumption of independence. Consider the events $A =
\{T(x) \leq t\}$ and $B = \{T(y) \leq t\}$. Now, $$\begin{aligned}
A \textrm{~and~} B &=& \{T(x) \leq t,T(y) \leq t\} = \{T(\overline{xy}) \leq t\} \\\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
A \textrm{~or~} B &=& \{T(xy) \leq t \} .\end{aligned}$$ Because
$\Pr(A \textrm{~or~} B) = \Pr(A)+\Pr(B) - \Pr(A
\textrm{~and~} B)$, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr(T(xy) \leq t) = \Pr(T(x) \leq t)+\Pr(T(y) \leq t) -
\Pr(T(\overline{xy}) \leq t)\end{aligned}$$ so that $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{\overline{xy}}  =~_t p_x + ~_t p_y - ~_t p_{xy}.\end{aligned}$$
Note that this relationship holds without using the assumption of
independence between lives.

### Lifetime Moments

For the expected survivor time of the joint life status, we have
$$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_{xy} = E ~ T(xy) &=& \int_0^{\infty} t f_T(xy)(t) dt =
\int_0^{\infty} (1-
F_T(xy)(t)) dt \\
&=& \int_0^{\infty} ~_t p_{xy} dt .\end{aligned}$$ The third equality
comes from an integration by parts.

Similarly, for the expected last-survivor time, $$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_{\overline{xy}} &=& E ~ T(\overline{xy}) = \int_0^{\infty}
~_t p_{\overline{xy}} ~ dt \\
&=& \int_0^{\infty}
\left(~_t p_x + ~_t p_y - ~_t p_{xy}\right) dt \\
&=& \dot{e}_{x}+\dot{e}_{y}-\dot{e}_{xy}.\end{aligned}$$ Note that this
relation holds without regard to the independence between lives
assumption.

**Special Case - Exponential Distribution.** Suppose that $T(x)$ is
exponentially distributed with force of mortality $\mu_x(t)=\mu_1$,
$T(y)$ is exponentially distributed with force of mortality
$\mu_y(t)=\mu_2$, and that $T(x)$ and $T(y)$ are independent. Then, for
$x$, we have $~_t p_x = \exp(-\mu_1 t)$ and $$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_x &=& E ~ T(x) = \int_0^{\infty} ~_t p_x ~ dt =
\frac{1}{\mu_1}\end{aligned}$$ Similarly, for the joint-life status, we
have $~_t p_{xy} = ~_t
p_{xy} \times ~_t p_{xy} =  \exp(-(\mu_1+\mu_2) t)$ which is an
exponential distribution with force of mortality $\mu_1+\mu_2$. This
yields $\dot{e}_{xy}=1/(\mu_1+\mu_2)$.

Now, for the last-survivor status, we have $$\begin{aligned}
1 - ~_t p_{\overline{xy}} &=& F_{T(\overline{xy})}(t) = \Pr\left(
\max(T(x),T(y)) \leq t \right) \\
&=&\Pr\left( T(x) \leq t \right)\Pr\left( T(y) \leq t \right) \\
&=& \left( 1-\exp(-\mu_1 t) \right)\Pr\left( 1-\exp(-\mu_2 t)\right)\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_{\overline{xy}} &=& \dot{e}_{x}+\dot{e}_{y}-\dot{e}_{xy}\\
&=& \frac{1}{\mu_1} +\frac{1}{\mu_2} -\frac{1}{\mu_1+\mu_2} .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Example - Exponential Distribution.** Suppose in addition that
$\mu_1 = 0.02$ and $\mu_2 = 0.015$. Then, $$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_x  = \frac{1}{\mu_1} = 50,~~~~\dot{e}_y  = \frac{1}{\mu_2} =
66.67, ~~~\dot{e}_{xy}  = \frac{1}{\mu_1+\mu_2} = 28.57 .\end{aligned}$$
Further, $$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_{\overline{xy}} &=& \dot{e}_{x}+\dot{e}_{y}-\dot{e}_{xy}\\
&=& 50 + 66.67 -28.57 = 88.1 .\end{aligned}$$ Moreover, we have
$$\begin{aligned}
Cov(T(\overline{xy}),T(xy)) &=& \mathrm{E~} \left\{T(\overline{xy})
\times T(xy)\right\} - \mathrm{E~} T(\overline{xy}) \times
\mathrm{E~}
T(xy)\\
&=& \mathrm{E~} \left\{\max(T(x),T(y)) \times \min
(T(x),T(y))\right\} - \dot{e}_{\overline{xy}} \times \dot{e}_{xy}\\
&=& \mathrm{E~}\left\{ T(x) \times T(y)\right\}
- \dot{e}_{\overline{xy}} \times \dot{e}_{xy}\\
&=& \dot{e}_x \dot{e}_y - \dot{e}_{\overline{xy}} \times
\dot{e}_{xy} = 50 \times 66.67 -  88.1 \times 28.57 = 816.48 .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Exercise.** Consider a population containing smokers ($s$) and
non-smokers ($ns$) where their forces of mortality are related as
$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_x^{ns} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_x^s .\end{aligned}$$ For the non-smoking
population, mortality is given as $l_x = 75 -
x$, $x \ge 0$. Consider two lives, a non-smoker age 65 and a smoker age
55, and assume lives are independent. Calculate $\dot{e}_{65:55}$.

*Solution.*

For non-smokers, the force of mortality is $\mu_x^{ns} =
\frac{-d~l_x}{dx} \frac{1}{l_x} = \frac{1}{75-x}$. Thus, the conditional
survival force is $~_t p_x^{ns} = 1 - \frac{t}{75-x}$.

For smokers, the force of mortality is $\mu_x^s = \frac{2}{75-x}$ so
that the conditional survival force is $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_x^s &=& \exp\left( - \int_0^t  \mu_{x+r}^s ~ dr \right) \\
&=& \exp\left( -2 \int_0^t \frac{1}{75-x-r} ~ dr \right) \\
&=& \exp\left( 2 \ln \left(75-x-r \right)|_0^t
 \right) \\
 &=& \exp \left( 2 \ln \frac{75-x-t}{75-x} \right)  \\
  &=& \left(1- \frac{t}{75-x} \right)^2\end{aligned}$$ Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{65:55} &=& ~_t p_{65}^{ns} ~_t p_{55}^s = \left(1-
\frac{t}{10} \right)\left(1- \frac{t}{20} \right)^2\end{aligned}$$ and
$$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_{65:55}&=& \int_0^{10} ~_t p_{65:55} dt \\
&=& \int_0^{10} \left(1- \frac{t}{10} \right)\left(1- \frac{t}{20}
\right)^2 dt = 3.54 .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

As follow-ups, note that

1\) $\dot{e}_{65}^{ns} =5 (=\frac{75-65}{2} )$.

2\) $\dot{e}_{55}^s = \int_0^{20} \left(1- \frac{t}{20} \right)^2 dt
= \frac{20}{3}$.

3\) $$\begin{aligned}
\dot{e}_{\overline{65:55}} &=& 5 + \frac{20}{3} - 3.54 = 8.12\\
&\neq & \int_0^{10} ~ _t p_{\overline{65:55}} ~dt .\end{aligned}$$

## Joint Life and Last-Survivor Annuities and Insurances

### Continuous Case

We are now in a position to express the expected present value (EPV) of
several annuity and insurance contracts using traditional notation. It
is convenient to begin with the continuous case when we know the exact
moment of payment. You will see that the treatment is completely
analogous to the single life case - thus, we will be brief in our
presentation of different variations.

To begin, a *joint life insurance* is a life insurance which pays a
benefit of 1 immediately upon the first to die of $x$ and $y$. It is
also known as a *first to die insurance*. In this case, the random
present value of future benefits is $v^{T(xy)} = \exp(-\delta T(xy))$
which has expected present value $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{xy} =
\int_0^{\infty}
e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_x  ~_t p_x  \left(\mu_{x+t} + \mu_{y+t} \right) ~ dt .\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, the EPV of last-survivor insurance, with pays a benefit of 1
immediately upon the second death, is $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{\overline{xy}} =
\int_0^{\infty}
e^{-\delta t} \left( ~_t q_y  ~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} + ~_t q_x  ~_t p_y \mu_{y+t} \right)~ dt .\end{aligned}$$

As can be seen from the expressions, the integrals can be a little
annoying to compute. Thus, it is often easier to work with the
corresponding annuities and then use the relationship between insurances
and annuities to evaluate the insurance quantities.

To this end, define a *joint life annuity* to be an annuity payable
until the first death of $x$ and $y$. That is, there is a continuous
payment at the rate of 1 per year while both are alive. In this case,
the EPV is $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{xy} =
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_{xy} ~ dt.\end{aligned}$$

The random variable underpinning the joint life annuity is
$\bar{a}_{\overline{T(xy)|}} = \frac{1-\exp(-\delta T(xy))}{\delta}$.
So, as with single life functions, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\text{joint life annuity rv} = \frac{1 - \text{joint life insurance rv}}{\delta}\end{aligned}$$
Taking expectations of each side yields $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{xy} = \frac{1 - \bar{A}_{xy}}{\delta},\end{aligned}$$ a
familiar relationship.

Similarly, a *last survivor annuity* is an annuity payable where there
is a continuous payment at the rate of 1 per year while at least one of
$x$ and $y$ is alive. In this case, the EPV is $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{\overline{xy}} = \bar{a}_x + \bar{a}_y - \bar{a}_{xy}\end{aligned}$$
and can be related to last-survivor insurance through the expression
$$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{\overline{xy}}  = \frac{1 - \bar{A}_{\overline{xy}} }{\delta}.\end{aligned}$$

As we will see in subsequent exercises and modules, temporary and
deferred annuities, as well as term, endowment and deferred insurances,
can be defined in a fashion similar to single life functions.

**Special Case: Premiums For Dependent Lives.** Consider a fully
continuous life insurance for $x$ and $y$. Suppose that

1\) premiums are payable until the first death

2\) a benefit of 1 is payable at the second death.

The joint mortality for $T(x)$ and $T(y)$ is not independent but given
by $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{xy} = r ~_t p_x + (1-r) ~_t p_x ~_t p_y.\end{aligned}$$ For
simplicity, assume that the mortality for $T(x)$ and $T(y)$ follow a
common exponential distribution, $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_x = e^{-\mu t} = ~_t p_y .\end{aligned}$$ Show that the annual
premium is $\frac{\mu(2\mu+\delta)}{\delta + (1+r)\mu}.$

Solution

The premium $P$ is the solution of
$\bar{A}_{\overline{xy}} = P \bar{a}_{xy}$. Now $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{a}_{xy} &=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_{xy} ~ dt \\
&=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} \left( r ~_t p_x + (1-r) ~_t p_x ~_t p_y \right) ~ dt \\
&=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} \left( r e^{-\mu t} + (1-r) e^{-2\mu t} \right) ~ dt \\
&=& \frac{r}{\mu+\delta} + \frac{1-r}{2\mu+\delta} = \frac{\delta+(1+r)\mu}{(\mu+\delta)(2\mu+\delta)}\end{aligned}$$
Further $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_x &=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_{xy} \mu_{x+t}~ dt \\
&=& \mu \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} e^{-\mu t} ~ dt = \frac{\mu}{\mu+\delta} = \bar{A}_y\end{aligned}$$and
$$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{\overline{xy}} = \bar{A}_x + \bar{A}_y - \bar{A}_{xy} =2 \frac{\mu}{\mu+\delta} -
\left( 1 - \delta \bar{a}_{xy} \right) .\end{aligned}$$ Thus
$$\begin{aligned}
P &=& \frac{\bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}}{\bar{a}_{xy}} = \frac{2 \frac{\mu}{\mu+\delta} -1}{\bar{a}_{xy}} - \delta \\
&=& \frac{\mu(2\mu+\delta)}{\delta + (1+r)\mu}.\end{aligned}$$

### Discrete Case

Start with a generic time until failure $T$ that may be a function of
one or more lives.

Define the curtate time until failure $K = [T]$, where $[\cdot]$ denotes
the greatest integer function.

Then, $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr(K=k) =  \Pr( k \le T < k+1) = F_T(k+1) - F_T(k).\end{aligned}$$

**Special Case. Joint Life Status.** In this case $T=T(xy)$, and so $K$
may be denoted as $K(xy) = [T(xy)]$. We may also think of the curtate
random variable as $K(xy) = \min(K(x), K(y))$.

This has probability mass function $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr(K=k) &=&   ~_{k+1} q_{xy} - ~ _k q_{xy}  =  ~ _k p_{xy} - ~_{k+1} p_{xy}\\
& =& ~ _k p_{xy} q_{x+k:y+k} \equiv ~_{k|} q_{xy} .\end{aligned}$$

For insurances, we have the “first-to-die” insurance $$\begin{aligned}
A_{xy} = \mathrm{E~} v^{K(xy)+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} v^{k+1}
~_{k|} q_{xy} .\end{aligned}$$ This is the EPV for a payment of 1 at the
end of the year of the first death among ($x$) and ($y$).

For annuities, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xy} = \mathrm{E~} \ddot{a}_{\overline{K(xy)+1}|} =
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} v^k ~ _k p_{xy} .\end{aligned}$$ This is the EPV for
a payment of 1 at the beginning of each year while both ($x$) and ($y$)
are alive.

$\Box$

**Special Case: Recursive Calculation for Discrete Joint Life
Annuities.** For a joint life annuity on lives $x$ and $y$ with payments
of 1 per year in advance, the EPV can be written recursively as:
$$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xy} = 1 +  v p_{xy} \ddot{a}_{x+1:y+1}.\end{aligned}$$

*Check:* The EPV is $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xy} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} v^k ~_k p_{xy} .\end{aligned}$$ By
successive conditioning, we may write $$\begin{aligned}
 ~_{k+1} p_{xy} =  p_{xy} ~_k p_{x+1:y+1} .\end{aligned}$$ Thus, using
$k=j+1$, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xy} &=& 1 +  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} v^k ~_k p_{xy} = 1 +  \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} v^{j+1} ~_{j+1} p_{xy} \\
&=& 1 +  v p_{xy} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} v^j ~_j p_{x+1:y+1} =1 +  v p_{xy} \ddot{a}_{x+1:y+1}.\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

### Generic Statuses

As with single life functions, one can readily extend fundamental
principles to handle many practical contracts. We indicate how to do so
in the discrete, with similar extensions to the continuous case
analogous

We will consider a generic status “$u$”.

**Varying Benefits and Payments**. Let $K$ be the curtate failure time
associated with that status. For an insurance benefit the pays $b_{K+1}$
for failure in the $K^{th}$ period, the EPV is $$\begin{aligned}
 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_{k+1} v^{k+1}
~_{k|} q_u .\end{aligned}$$

For an annuity benefit that pays $\pi_h$ at the beginning of each year
when the status $u$ has survived, the EPV is $$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{E~} \left( \sum_{h=0}^K \pi_h v^h \right)=
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \pi_k v^k ~ _k p_u .\end{aligned}$$

$\Box$

**Generic Status - Insurance and Annuities**. Temporary and deferred
annuities, as well as endowment and deferred insurances, can be defined
in a fashion similar to single life functions.

Consider two lives, $x$ and $y$ but let $T(y)=n$ with probability one.
Then, for the joint life status, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xy} = \ddot{a}_{x:\overline{n|}}\end{aligned}$$ and
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{xy} = A_{x:\overline{n|}}\end{aligned}$$ Similarly for the
last-survivor status, $$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{\overline{xy}} = \ddot{a}_{\overline{x:\overline{n|}}}
=\ddot{a}_x +\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}} - \ddot{a}_{x:\overline{n|}}
=\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}} + ~_{n|} \ddot{a}_x\end{aligned}$$ an annuity
that is payable for certain for $n$ years and as long as ($x$) survives
thereafter.

$\Box$

**Generic Status - Multiple Lives**. We can allow multiples lives on a
contract, say, $x$, $y$, and $z$, in the same fashion. For example,
compute the survival function $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p _{xyz} = ~_t p _x \times ~_t p _y \times ~_t p _z\end{aligned}$$
assuming independence among lives.

Further, we can one life, say $z$, but let $T(z)=n$ with probability
one. Then, for example, the joint life annuity on the triple becomes
$$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xyz} = \ddot{a}_{xy:\overline{n|}}\end{aligned}$$ a temporary
joint life annuity on the joint status $xy$. In this way, we can
introduce temporary and deferred annuities, as well as endowment and
deferred insurances, for the joint life status and last-survivor status.

$\Box$

To summarize, here are some examples of different statuses we regularly
consider:

[cl|cl]{} Status ($u$) & Description & Status ($u$) & Description\
\
$xy$ & joint-life & $\overline{xy:\overline{n|}}$ & $n$-year guaranteed\
$\overline{xy}$ & last-survivor & $~ _{x:\overline{n|}}^1$ &
contingent\
$xyz$ & joint lives & $~ _{xy}^1$ & contingent\
$xy:\overline{n|}$ & temporary & $x|y$ & reversionary\

## Common Shock Model for Dependent Lives

Suppose that $T^{\ast}(x)$ and $T^{\ast}(y)$ are unobserved future
lifetimes for $x$ and $y$ that are independent of one another. Let $Z$
be a lifetime random variable that is common to both $x$ and $y$ for
e.g., disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. Take $T^{\ast}(x)$,
$T^{\ast}(y)$, $Z$ to be mutually independent.

Let $T(x)= \min(T^{\ast}(x),Z)$ and $T(y)= \min(T^{\ast}(y),Z)$ be the
observed future lifetimes for $x$ and $y$. Note that they are not
independent because they share the common shock random variable $Z$.

For convenience, assume that the distribution of $Z$ is exponential with
constant force $\lambda$.

Now, the survival function for $x$ is $$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_x = \Pr(T(x) > t) = \Pr(\min(T^{\ast}(x),Z)>t) =
\Pr(T^{\ast}(x)>t) \Pr(Z>t) = ~_t p_x^{\ast} e^{-\lambda t}\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, $~_t p_y = ~_t p_y^{\ast} e^{-\lambda t}$. The joint survival
probability is 
$$\begin{aligned}
~_t p_{xy} &= \Pr(\min(T(x),T(y)) > t) = \Pr(\min(T^{\ast}(x),T^{\ast}(y),Z)>t) \\
&=\Pr(T^{\ast}(x)>t) \Pr(T^{\ast}(y)>t)\Pr(Z>t) = ~_t p_x^{\ast} ~_t p_y^{\ast} e^{-\lambda t}\\
&= ~_t p_x ~_t p_y e^{\lambda t} .\end{aligned}$$

From this, we can also calculate the joint force of mortality $$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{xy}(t)  &= \frac{-\partial }{\partial t} \ln ~_t p_{xy}  \\
&=
= \frac{-\partial}{\partial t} \left(\ln~_t p_x+\ln ~_t p_y +\ln e^{\lambda t} \right) \\
&=\mu_x(t) + \mu_y(t) - \lambda .\end{aligned}$$

**Example.** You have calculated the expected present value of a last
survivor life insurance of 1 on $x$ and $y$. You assumed:

The death benefit is payable immediately on the second death.

The future lifetimes of $x$ and $y$ are independent, and each life has a
constant force of mortality with $\mu=0.06$.

Assume $\delta = 0.05$.

Your supervisor points out that these are not independent future
lifetimes. Each mortality assumption is correct, but each includes a
common shock component with constant force 0.02.

Calculate the increase in the expected present value over what you
originally calculated.

*Solution.*

We wish to calculate
$\bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}^{CS} - \bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}^{IND}$. Under
the independence model, we have $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_x  &=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} dt =\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} e^{-\mu t} \mu dt = \frac{\mu}{\mu+\delta} .\end{aligned}$$
Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_x  = \frac{0.06}{0.06+0.05} = \frac{6}{11} = \bar{A}_y  .\end{aligned}$$
Further, $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{xy}  &=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_{xy} \mu_{xy}(t) dt =\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} e^{-2\mu t} 2\mu dt = \frac{2\mu}{2\mu+\delta} ,\end{aligned}$$
so that $\bar{A}_{xy}  = \frac{0.12}{0.17} =  \frac{12}{17}$ and
$$\begin{aligned}
 \bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}^{IND} = \bar{A}_x +\bar{A}_y-\bar{A}_{xy} = 2 \frac{6}{11} -\frac{12}{17} = 0.385 .\end{aligned}$$
For the common shock model, the original force of mortality was 0.06, so
the new force of mortality is 0.04. Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_x  &=& \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\delta t} ~_t p_x \mu_{x+t} dt =\int_0^{\infty} e^{-0.05t} e^{-0.04 t} e^{-0.02 t}\mu dt = \frac{6}{11},\end{aligned}$$
as before. The same is true for $\bar{A}_y$. The joint force of
mortality is $\mu_{xy}(t) = 0.06+0.06-0.02 = 0.10$. Thus, the joint
survival function is $~_t p_{xy} = e^{-0.10 t}$. This yields
$$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{xy}^{CS}  = \frac{\mu_{xy}}{\mu_{xy}+\delta} =\frac{0.10}{0.10+0.05} = \frac{2}{3},\end{aligned}$$
and $$\begin{aligned}
 \bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}^{CS} = \bar{A}_x +\bar{A}_y-\bar{A}_{xy}^{CS}  = 2 \frac{6}{11} -\frac{2}{3} = 0.42423 .\end{aligned}$$
Thus, the increase is $$\begin{aligned}
\bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}^{CS} - \bar{A}_{\overline{xy}}^{IND} = 0.42423 - 0.385 = 0.0392.\end{aligned}$$

## Additional Examples and Applications

### First To Die with Mortality Adjustments

The traditional “first to die” insurance pays 1 at the end of the year
of death of either ($x$) or ($y$). The expected present value of this
insurance is $$\begin{aligned}
A_{xy}  = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} v^{k+1} ~_k p_{xy} q_{x+k:y+k}\end{aligned}$$
where $_k p_{xy}$ is the probability that both ($x$) and ($y$) survive
$k$ years and $q_{x+k:y+k}$ is the probability that at least one of
($x+k$) and ($y+k$) dies within the year. To evaluate this, it is
customary to begin by assuming independent lives, so that
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{xy}^{IND}  = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} v^{k+1} ~_k p_x  ~_k p_y (1- p_{x+k} \times p_{y+k}) .\end{aligned}$$
From the formula for $A_{xy}^{IND}$, it is easy to see that as interest
increases, the expected present value decreases.

What about mortality? Let us think of ($x$) as a male life and ($y$) as
a female life. Consider a mortality adjustment to male lives of the form
$$\begin{aligned}
q_x^{revised}  = (1-c) \times q_x^{base}.\end{aligned}$$ This is a
coarse adjustment but will give us a flavor as to what happens to
insurance prices as mortality increases or decreases. Viewers should
verify that $A_{xy}^{IND}$ increases as the adjustment coefficient $c$
decreases. (Although a separate exercise, at $c \approx 0.35$, male
mortality is roughly equivalent to female mortality for our Indonesian
data.)

The dynamic graph shows values of $A_{xy}^{IND}$ plotted against
interest rate $i$ and age, where for plotting purposes we use a common
age $x=y$. The graph shows the dynamic effect over $c$ ranging from -0.5
to 0.5. This graph shows that the expected present value $A_{xy}^{IND}$
decreases as either $i$ or $c$ increases. Moreover, it also gives a feel
for the amount of the increase. Based on the magnitude of these
increases, one interpretation is that changes in interest rates have a
greater effect than changes in mortality on the expected present value.

### Reduction Factors for Joint and Surviving Annuities

At retirement from employment, it is common for pension plan
participants to have earned a lifetime annuity in the amount of $PEN$
per year whose expected present value is $PEN \ddot{a}_x$. Suppose that
the participant has a spouse (or other dependent) age ($y$) and wishes
to purchase an annuity that continues to provide benefits even after
($x$) has died to the survivor ($y$). For example, a joint and 75%
survivor annuity makes an annual payment of 1 while both ($x$) and ($y$)
are alive, a payment of 0.75 while only one of ($x$) and ($y$) are
alive, and no payments following the death of both ($x$) and ($y$).
Thus, expected present value of this annuity is
$0.75 (\ddot{a}_x + \ddot{a}_y) - 0.50 \ddot{a}_{xy}$. To equate these
values, we would require the new pension amount $PEN_{JS}$ to be that
amount so that $PEN \ddot{a}_x = PEN_{JS}
\left(0.75 \times (\ddot{a}_x + \ddot{a}_y) - 0.50 \ddot{a}_{xy}
\right)$. More generally, define the annuity factor $$\begin{aligned}
ANN~FACTOR = \frac{\ddot{a}_x}{RED (\ddot{a}_x + \ddot{a}_y) + (1-2RED) \ddot{a}_{xy}},\end{aligned}$$
for the reduction factor $RED$.

The dynamic graph shows values of $ANN~FACTOR$ plotted against the
reduction factor $RED$ and age, where for plotting purposes we use a
common age $x=y$. The graph shows the dynamic effect over interest rate
$i$ ranging from 0 to 20%. The graph shows that it is difficult to
provide a general interpretation for the reduction percentage and age.
However, as the interest rate $i$ increases, the factor approaches one
for all values of the reduction percentage and age.

### Dependent Joint Life Annuities with Common Shock

Using the common shock model, we can relate the joint survival
probabilities to the marginal survival probabilities through the
expression $$\begin{aligned}
~_k p_{xy} &=  e^{\lambda k} ~_k p_x ~_k p_y  .\end{aligned}$$ With
this, we may express the dependent joint life annuity as
$$\begin{aligned}
\ddot{a}_{xy}^{DEP} &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} e^{-\delta k} ~_k p_{xy}= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} e^{-\delta k} e^{\lambda k} ~_k p_x ~_k p_y \\
&= \ddot{a}_{xy}^{IND} @(\delta-\lambda) .\end{aligned}$$ Here,
$\ddot{a}_{xy}^{IND} @(\delta-\lambda)$ is joint life annuity calculated
assuming ($x$) and ($y$) are independent lives at a revised force of
interest $\delta-\lambda$.

This result means that the common shock model provides an easy method
for incorporating dependencies among lives. In their study of data from
a Canadian insurer, Frees, Valdez and Carrière (1996) established
statistically significant dependence among annuitant lives using several
models. For the common shock model, they estimated $\lambda$ to be
0.00054, for a mean time of common shock that is about
$1/0.00054 \approx 2,000$ years. This value of $\lambda$ is small
relative to interest rates typically used in practice and so has a minor
impact on annuity valuation. Frees et al. also pointed out that the
common shock model does not seem to capture all aspects of dependencies
among lives. Although it is commonly accepted that annuitant lives are
not independent, the research literature has not yet reached a consensus
on the best method for incorporating this dependence.
